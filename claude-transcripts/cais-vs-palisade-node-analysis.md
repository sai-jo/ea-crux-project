# CAIS vs Palisade: High-Leverage Node Analysis

*Which org better targets the nodes that are both tractable AND consequential?*

---

## The Highest-Leverage Nodes

From the AI Transition Model, only **3 nodes** score high on BOTH changeability (≥50) AND x-risk impact (≥60):

| Node | Changeability | X-Risk Impact | Combined Score |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Gradual AI Takeover** | 55 | 80 | 44.0 |
| **AI Governance** | 55 | 60 | 33.0 |
| **Racing Intensity** | 50 | 65 | 32.5 |

These are the "sweet spot" nodes - both tractable AND consequential. Work targeting these nodes has the highest expected impact.

## Which Org Targets These Better?

| High-Leverage Node | CAIS Approach | Palisade Approach | Winner |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Gradual AI Takeover** | Indirect (alignment research, benchmarks) | **Direct** (shutdown resistance is empirical evidence of gradual takeover precursors) | **Palisade** |
| **AI Governance** | **Direct** (2023 Statement, policy briefings, benchmarks as standards) | Indirect (demos inform policy) | **CAIS** |
| **Racing Intensity** | Moderate (Statement shifted discourse) | **Strong** (scary demos slow racing) | **Tie/Palisade** |

---

## The Key Insight

**Palisade directly targets the single highest-leverage node** (Gradual AI Takeover: 55 × 80 = 44.0).

Their shutdown resistance research isn't just "technical safety work" - it's the most direct empirical evidence that the gradual takeover pathway is real and already emerging in current models. This node has:
- The highest combined score of any node meeting both thresholds
- The highest trajectoryImpact (90) of any sub-item in the entire model

**CAIS directly targets AI Governance** (55 × 60 = 33.0), but this is a lower-leverage node than Gradual Takeover.

## Implications

### If You Trust the Node Ratings

| Assumption | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Gradual Takeover is the top node | Palisade's shutdown work is optimally positioned |
| Changeability matters as much as x-risk | High-changeability governance nodes favor advocacy/demos |
| Tractability × Impact = leverage | Palisade's focused approach beats CAIS's breadth |

### The Biosecurity Exception

**Biosecurity (45, 80) just misses the changeability threshold** (45 < 50). This is CAIS's strongest unique contribution. If you believe:
- Biosecurity is more tractable than the rating suggests, OR
- X-risk impact matters more than changeability

...then CAIS's VCT and WMDP work becomes more valuable relative to Palisade.

## Final Scoring

### Node Coverage of High-Leverage Targets

| Org | Gradual Takeover (44.0) | AI Governance (33.0) | Racing Intensity (32.5) | Total Coverage |
|-----|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Palisade** | ★★★ Direct | ★★ Indirect (demos) | ★★ Indirect (demos) | **High** |
| **CAIS** | ★ Indirect | ★★★ Direct | ★★ Moderate | **Medium-High** |

### Summary

The node-scoring exercise predicts that **orgs targeting Gradual Takeover, AI Governance, and Racing Intensity should have highest expected impact**.

- **Palisade hits all three** (one directly via shutdown research, two via advocacy effects from visceral demonstrations)
- **CAIS hits two strongly** (AI Governance directly, Racing Intensity moderately) but only indirectly addresses Gradual Takeover

**Conclusion**: If the model's ratings are accurate, Palisade has better positioning on the highest-leverage nodes, particularly due to their unique focus on shutdown resistance as direct evidence for the Gradual AI Takeover pathway.

## Caveats

1. **Ratings are uncertain** - the changeability and x-risk impact scores are estimates, not measurements
2. **Indirect effects are hard to quantify** - the "advocacy multiplier" is a judgment call
3. **Counterfactual impact differs from total impact** - CAIS's benchmarks might be produced by others; Palisade's demos are more unique
4. **Time horizons matter** - CAIS's field-building compounds over decades; Palisade's demos have immediate but potentially shorter-lived impact

# Palisade Research: Revised Impact Assessment

*Revision of initial analysis accounting for advocacy multiplier effects*

---

## Summary

Initial analysis underweighted two key factors:
1. **CTF/Cyber work** - unique infrastructure for detecting autonomous AI hacking
2. **Demonstrations as advocacy** - visceral demos influence governance nodes beyond direct technical impact

---

## CTF/Cyber Work: Direct Impact

The cyber threat exposure node (changeability 35, x-risk 55) appears modest, but Palisade's work is uniquely positioned:

| Palisade Cyber Research | Why It Matters |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **GPT-5 CTF performance** (25th place, beating 93% of humans) | First rigorous measurement of AI elite hacking capability |
| **AI Honeypot** (1.7M+ interactions, 10 countries) | Only live detection system for autonomous AI hacking attempts |
| **September 2025 Anthropic incident** was predicted by this work | Their research anticipated the "first AI-orchestrated cyberattack" |

The honeypot is especially counterfactually valuable - no one else is building infrastructure to *detect* autonomous AI cyber operations in the wild.

---

## Demonstrations as Advocacy Multiplier

"Moving demos" don't just affect Technical AI Safety - they create **indirect leverage** on high-changeability governance nodes:

| Node | Changeability | X-Risk Impact | Combined | Demo Effect |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Lab Safety Practices** | 65 | 50 | 32.5 | "o3 resisted shutdown" pressures labs |
| **AI Governance** | 55 | 60 | 33.0 | BIS comments, congressional testimony |
| **Racing Intensity** | 50 | 65 | 32.5 | Scary demos slow the race |
| **Gradual Takeover** | 55 | 80 | 44.0 | Direct evidence of precursor behavior |

### Why This Matters

1. **Lab Safety Practices has the highest changeability (65)** of any node. Palisade's demos directly pressure labs - "your model resists shutdown" is harder to ignore than a benchmark score.

2. **Demonstrations travel further than papers**. The "o3 resisted shutdown in 79/100 trials" headline reached mainstream media. Academic benchmarks influence researchers; Palisade's demos influence executives and regulators.

3. **Cyber honeypot is infrastructure**. Like field-building grants, this creates ongoing value - every autonomous hacking attempt detected builds the evidence base.

4. **Racing intensity is high-leverage** (changeability 50, x-risk 65). If scary demos slow the race even marginally, the compounding effects on safety timelines are large.

## Revised Impact Calculation

Adding an "advocacy multiplier" for nodes Palisade influences indirectly through demonstrations:

| Node | Focus | Calculation | Score |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Technical AI Safety | Direct (1.0) | 45 × 85 × 1.0 | 3,825 |
| Cyber Threat Exposure | Direct (1.0) | 35 × 55 × 1.0 | 1,925 |
| Gradual Takeover | Direct (1.0) | 55 × 80 × 1.0 | 4,400 |
| Lab Safety Practices | Advocacy (0.5) | 65 × 50 × 0.5 | 1,625 |
| AI Governance | Advocacy (0.5) | 55 × 60 × 0.5 | 1,650 |
| Racing Intensity | Advocacy (0.3) | 50 × 65 × 0.3 | 975 |
| Epistemics (deepfakes) | Secondary (0.5) | 25 × 40 × 0.5 | 500 |
| **Total** | | | **14,900** |

**Revised Score: 14.9** (up from initial 10.7)

## Revised Verdict

### Comparison with CAIS

| Metric | CAIS | Palisade (Revised) |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Impact Score** | 13.7 | **14.9** |
| **Direct technical nodes** | 6 | 4 |
| **Advocacy leverage nodes** | 2 | 4 |
| **Unique contributions** | Biosecurity benchmarks | Shutdown demos, live honeypot |

### Strength Comparison

| Strength | CAIS | Palisade |
|----------|------|----------|
| Research infrastructure | ★★★ | ★ |
| Policy demonstrations | ★★ | ★★★ |
| Biosecurity | ★★★ | - |
| Corrigibility/shutdown | ★ | ★★★ |
| Cyber threat detection | - | ★★★ |
| Lab pressure | ★ | ★★★ |

### Conclusion

**Palisade edges out CAIS when accounting for advocacy effects** - but the orgs are complementary:

- **CAIS** excels at systematic coverage, field-building infrastructure, and biosecurity (a node Palisade doesn't touch)
- **Palisade** excels at visceral evidence production, unique detection infrastructure, and direct pressure on labs

The optimal portfolio probably includes both - CAIS for systematic coverage and field-building, Palisade for visceral evidence and unique detection infrastructure.

---

## Marginal Donation Consideration

- **Palisade**: SFF 1:1 match (up to $1.1M) increases marginal impact
- **CAIS**: Larger budget (~$5M) may reduce marginal leverage, but infrastructure spending compounds

Both are fundable; allocation depends on donor's theory of change regarding demonstrations vs. systematic research.

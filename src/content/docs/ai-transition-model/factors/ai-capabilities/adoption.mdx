Adoption measures how widely AI systems are integrated into economic activities, daily life, and critical infrastructure. This encompasses not just the deployment of AI tools but the depth of integration—from surface-level assistance to foundational dependence where systems and organizations cannot function without AI.

Broader adoption amplifies both the benefits of AI systems and the potential harms from failures, misalignment, or misuse. Deep adoption creates path dependencies that make reversal difficult—once critical infrastructure depends on AI systems, removing those systems becomes increasingly costly. Managing adoption trajectory while maintaining human capability and reversibility represents a key challenge.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 40 | Policy and market forces can influence adoption speed |
| X-risk Impact | 45 | Affects vulnerability but not primary risk sources |
| Trajectory Impact | 70 | Shapes societal dependence and reversibility |
| Uncertainty | 40 | Adoption trends observable but future pace unclear |

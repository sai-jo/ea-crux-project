Algorithms encompass the methods, architectures, and techniques that determine how efficiently AI systems convert computational resources into capabilities. Algorithmic progress effectively multiplies the impact of compute—a more efficient algorithm can achieve the same capabilities with less hardware, or significantly greater capabilities with the same resources.

Unlike compute, algorithms are intangible—they can be discovered independently, shared instantly through publications or code, and cannot be physically controlled. This makes direct algorithmic governance nearly impossible, shifting focus to controlling compute and data, and establishing evaluation protocols that can detect concerning capabilities before deployment.

## Overview

AI Capabilities refers to how powerful AI systems become across multiple dimensions. This is a key root factor in the AI Transition Model because capability levels directly influence the probability and severity of various scenarios.

**For detailed tracking of current AI capabilities, see the [Capabilities section](/knowledge-base/capabilities/).**

## Capability Categories

The Knowledge Base tracks capabilities across several domains:

| Capability | Status | Risk Relevance |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| [Language Models](/knowledge-base/capabilities/language-models/) | Rapidly advancing | Foundation for all other capabilities |
| [Reasoning](/knowledge-base/capabilities/reasoning/) | Emerging | Key for general intelligence |
| [Coding](/knowledge-base/capabilities/coding/) | Human-competitive | Enables self-improvement |
| [Agentic AI](/knowledge-base/capabilities/agentic-ai/) | Early stage | Enables autonomous action |
| [Tool Use](/knowledge-base/capabilities/tool-use/) | Growing | Expands action space |
| [Scientific Research](/knowledge-base/capabilities/scientific-research/) | Emerging | Could accelerate capability growth |
| [Situational Awareness](/knowledge-base/capabilities/situational-awareness/) | Emerging | Key prerequisite for scheming |
| [Self-improvement](/knowledge-base/capabilities/self-improvement/) | Theoretical | Could lead to recursive improvement |
| [Persuasion](/knowledge-base/capabilities/persuasion/) | Concerning | Enables manipulation at scale |
| [Long-horizon Tasks](/knowledge-base/capabilities/long-horizon/) | Early stage | Enables complex autonomous projects |

## Relationship to Scenarios

Higher AI capabilities primarily increase the probability and severity of **AI Takeover** scenarios:

- **[Rapid Takeover](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/rapid/)**: Requires sufficient capability for decisive action
- **[Gradual Takeover](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/gradual/)**: Enabled by increasing autonomy and generality over time

Capabilities also affect [Human-Caused Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/human-catastrophe/) scenarios by enabling more powerful [Bioweapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/bioweapons/), [Cyberweapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/cyberweapons/), and [Autonomous Weapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/autonomous-weapons/).

## Current Trajectory

AI capabilities are advancing rapidly across all dimensions, driven by:
- Scaling laws (more compute, data, parameters)
- Algorithmic improvements (transformers, RLHF, reasoning chains)
- Hardware advances (specialized AI chips, larger clusters)
- Increased investment (~$100B+ annually in US alone)

**Key metrics** are tracked at [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) and [Stanford HAI AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/).

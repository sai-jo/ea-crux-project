Adaptability measures how quickly institutions, economies, and social structures can adjust to rapid technological change without breaking down. This parameter captures society's capacity to absorb shocks, reconfigure systems, and maintain functionality during periods of accelerating AI-driven disruption.

The AI transition creates adaptation demands across every major social system simultaneously. [Economic disruption](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/economic-disruption/) from AI-driven automation affects 40-60% of jobs in advanced economies. The World Economic Forum estimates 83 million jobs lost and 69 million created by 2027, yielding a net loss of 14 million positions. Unlike previous technological transitions that unfolded over decades, AI-driven change may occur on timescales of years. [Flash dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/flash-dynamics/)—where AI systems interact faster than human oversight—compound these challenges.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 30/100 | Structural adaptation takes time |
| X-risk Impact | 50/100 | Moderate existential impact |
| Trajectory Impact | 60/100 | Significant influence on long-term outcomes |
| Uncertainty | 50/100 | Moderate uncertainty about adaptive capacity |

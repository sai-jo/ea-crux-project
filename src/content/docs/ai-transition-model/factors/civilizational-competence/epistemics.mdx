Epistemics refers to society's collective ability to form accurate beliefs, resist misinformation, and maintain shared understanding of reality. This parameter measures the health of knowledge-producing institutions, verification mechanisms, and the capacity for rational public discourse essential to democratic governance and coordinated response to AI risks.

AI poses unprecedented challenges to epistemic foundations. Where previous information warfare required human labor and left detectable traces, AI enables automated generation of convincing text, images, audio, and video at minimal cost. Human deepfake detection accuracy is only 55.5%—barely above chance—while AI-generated political content is rated 82% more convincing than human-written equivalents. Voice cloning now requires just 3 seconds of audio. This technological shift potentially severs the link between seeing and believing that has anchored human epistemology for millennia.

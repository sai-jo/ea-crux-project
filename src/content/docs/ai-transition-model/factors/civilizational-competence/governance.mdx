Governance encompasses the quality of political institutions, regulatory capacity, and the ability to create effective AI policy. This parameter measures how well society's formal decision-making structures can understand, evaluate, and respond to AI developments through legislation, regulation, and institutional coordination.

The fundamental challenge is a race against time: AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, while institutional adaptation typically operates on years to decades. Historical analysis shows regulatory lag spanning 15-70 years for transformative technologies. The [Institutional Adaptation Speed Model](/knowledge-base/models/governance-models/institutional-adaptation-speed/) estimates institutions currently change at only 10-30% of the needed rate while AI creates 50-200% annual governance gaps.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 35/100 | Institutional reforms take years |
| X-risk Impact | 55/100 | Significant impact on existential risk pathways |
| Trajectory Impact | 70/100 | High influence on long-term outcomes |
| Uncertainty | 45/100 | Moderate uncertainty about governance effectiveness |

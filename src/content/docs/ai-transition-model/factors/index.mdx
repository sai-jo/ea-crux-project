## Overview

Root Factors are the top-level causal drivers that shape AI transition outcomes. They bridge the gap between specific [component parameters](#) and [ultimate outcomes](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/) like existential catastrophe and long-term trajectory.

See the [interactive AI transition model](/ai-transition-model/) for a visual representation.

AI governance encompasses policies, regulations, and institutional frameworks shaping AI development and deployment. The [EU AI Act](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/legislation/eu-ai-act/) represents the first comprehensive legal framework, while [AI Safety Institutes](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/ai-safety-institutes/) provide government technical capacity to evaluate advanced systems.

[Racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) pose a fundamental challenge: competitive pressure has shortened safety evaluation timelines by 40-60% since ChatGPT's launch. International coordination faces hurdles despite progress like the Bletchley Declaration (28 countries) and Seoul AI Safety Commitments (16 companies), as voluntary frameworks lack binding enforcement.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 55 | Policy windows exist but institutional inertia creates friction |
| X-risk Impact | 60 | Shapes incentives and constraints for AI development |
| Trajectory Impact | 75 | High impact through shaping norms and power distribution |
| Uncertainty | 50 | Political dynamics are somewhat predictable but volatile |

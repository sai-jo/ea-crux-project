Lab safety practices encompass internal procedures, culture, and governance at AI organizations that determine how safely frontier systems are built. Because most safety-relevant decisions never reach regulators, lab-level practices fundamentally shape risk. The Future of Life Institute Winter 2025 AI Safety Index found no company scored above C+ overall, with every company receiving D or below on existential safety measures.

[Responsible Scaling Policies](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/industry/responsible-scaling-policies/) are the primary self-regulatory framework, covering approximately 60-70% of frontier development with estimated 10-25% risk reduction. [Red-teaming](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/red-teaming/) has become critical but faces scaling limitations. High-profile safety researcher departures suggest ongoing tension between competitive pressures and safety investment.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 65 | Can shift quickly with leadership or external pressure |
| X-risk Impact | 50 | Matters but downstream of technical safety and governance |
| Trajectory Impact | 45 | Influences near-term safety; less determinative long-term |
| Uncertainty | 40 | Somewhat observable through public commitments and reports |

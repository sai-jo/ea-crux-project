Biological Threat Exposure measures how AI systems increase the risk of catastrophic biological attacks by democratizing dangerous knowledge. The core concern is that AI makes capabilities previously requiring rare expertise accessible to a broader range of actors—the [AI Uplift Assessment Model](/knowledge-base/models/domain-models/bioweapons-ai-uplift/) estimates current AI provides 1.3-2.5x uplift for novice actors.

Empirical evidence remains contested. RAND's 2024 study found no significant AI uplift, while Microsoft found AI-designed toxins evaded 75%+ of DNA synthesis screening. In 2025, both OpenAI and Anthropic flagged biological capabilities as reaching concerning thresholds in their frontier models.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 45 | Moderately changeable through biosecurity measures and model restrictions |
| X-risk Impact | 80 | High—one of the most direct pathways to catastrophic harm |
| Trajectory Impact | 40 | Primarily affects near-term risk levels |
| Uncertainty | 60 | Substantial uncertainty around actual uplift magnitude |

- How much does AI actually help with bioweapons—marginal or transformative?
- Does AI help biodefense more than bioattack, or vice versa?
- Are wet lab skills the real bottleneck, making AI uplift less relevant?

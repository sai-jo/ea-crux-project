Cyber Threat Exposure quantifies how AI capabilities amplify offensive cyber operations and shift the offense-defense balance toward attackers. Unlike theoretical risks, AI-assisted cyberattacks are already occurring at scale—2025 saw AI-powered attacks surge 72% year-over-year, with 87% of organizations reporting AI-driven incidents.

The September 2025 Anthropic disclosure marked a watershed: the first documented AI-orchestrated cyberattack where AI executed 80-90% of tactical operations autonomously, targeting approximately 30 global entities. AI-generated phishing now achieves 54% click-through rates versus 12% for non-AI phishing—a 4.5x effectiveness improvement.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 35 | Difficult—cyber threats are pervasive with structural defense disadvantages |
| X-risk Impact | 55 | Moderate-high—primarily through infrastructure attacks enabling other risks |
| Trajectory Impact | 45 | Moderate—economic disruption and erosion of digital trust |
| Uncertainty | 50 | Well-documented threats but offense-defense balance remains contested |

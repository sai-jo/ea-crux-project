Economic stability during the AI transition captures the balance between AI-driven displacement and society's capacity to absorb affected workers. The IMF estimates 40% of global jobs are exposed to AI automation, while displacement rates of 2-5% may outpace adaptation capacity of 1-3% annually.

Several factors amplify instability: racing dynamics compress adaptation windows, winner-take-all effects concentrate benefits in few firms and regions, and feedback loops can cascade job losses into demand collapse. However, stabilizing mechanisms exist through labor transition policies, safety nets, and proactive intervention.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 40 | Requires coordinated policy across governments and industries |
| X-risk Impact | 35 | Lower direct x-risk contribution; affects transition quality |
| Trajectory Impact | 55 | Substantial influence through institutional path dependence |
| Uncertainty | 50 | Historical precedents exist but AI transition may differ |

- Can governments effectively redistribute AI-generated wealth?
- Will AI create enough new jobs to offset displacement, or is this transition fundamentally different?

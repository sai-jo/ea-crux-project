## Overview

Ultimate Outcomes represent what we fundamentally care about when thinking about AI's impact on humanity. Unlike [Scenarios](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/) (which describe intermediate scenarios) or [parameters](/ai-transition-model/) (which measure specific factors), Ultimate Outcomes describe the **final states** we're trying to achieve or avoid.

There are two Ultimate Outcomes:

1. **[Existential Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/existential-catastrophe/)** — Does catastrophe occur?
2. **[Long-term Trajectory](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/long-term-trajectory/)** — What's the expected value of the future?

## Why Two Outcomes?

Previous versions of this framework had three outcomes (including "Transition Smoothness"). We moved to two because:

1. **Transition Turbulence is a pathway, not endpoint**: How rough the transition is affects *both* existential catastrophe and long-term trajectory. It belongs in [Root Factors](/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/).

2. **Cleaner analytical structure**: Two outcomes are genuinely orthogonal:
   - You can have low existential catastrophe but poor long-term trajectory (safe dystopia)
   - You can have high existential catastrophe but good conditional value (high-stakes gamble)

3. **Temporal clarity**: Existential Catastrophe is primarily about the transition period; Long-term Trajectory is about what comes after.

## How They Relate

These outcomes are **partially independent**—you can have different combinations:

| Scenario | Existential Catastrophe | Long-term Trajectory | Example |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Best case | Low | High | Aligned AI, smooth transition, flourishing |
| Safe dystopia | Low | Low | No catastrophe but authoritarian lock-in |
| High-stakes success | High (survived) | High | Near-misses but good outcome |
| Extinction | Very High | N/A | Catastrophe occurs |

This independence means:
- **Different Ultimate Scenarios affect different Ultimate Outcomes**
- **Trade-offs exist**: Some approaches that reduce existential catastrophe might worsen long-term trajectory (e.g., authoritarian control)
- **Both matter**: We shouldn't sacrifice one entirely for the other

| Ultimate Scenario | Affects Existential Catastrophe | Affects Long-term Trajectory |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [AI Takeover](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/) | Yes (primary pathway) | Yes (shapes future) |
| [Human-Caused Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/human-catastrophe/) | Yes (primary pathway) | — |
| [Long-term Lock-in](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/long-term-lockin/) | Yes (bad lock-in) | Yes (primary determinant) |

Each ultimate scenario has sub-variants with different probability estimates. See the [Ultimate Scenarios](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/) section for details.

## Temporal Structure

These outcomes map to different phases of the AI transition:

| Phase | Primary Concern | Relevant Outcome |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Pre-transformative AI** (now) | Building capacity, avoiding racing | Existential Catastrophe (preparation) |
| **Existential Catastrophe Period** | Surviving the transition | Existential Catastrophe |
| **Resolution** | How it resolves | Both |
| **Long-run Trajectory** | Quality of the future | Long-term Trajectory |

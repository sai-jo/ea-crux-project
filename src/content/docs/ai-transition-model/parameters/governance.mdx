Governance Capacity measures our collective ability to steer AI development through policy, regulation, and coordination. This is the **cross-cutting aggregate**—it affects all three outcome dimensions because governance shapes both what we build and how we deploy it.

**Outcomes affected:** All three
- [Existential Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/existential-catastrophe/) ↓↓ — Can we slow down or stop if needed?
- [Transition](/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/) ↓↓ — Are disruptions managed?
- [Steady State](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/long-term-trajectory/) ↓↓ — Who controls the future?

| Parameter | Role | Current State |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| [Regulatory Capacity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/regulatory-capacity/) | Can governments understand and regulate AI? | Improving (EU AI Act) but lagging |
| [Institutional Quality](/ai-transition-model/parameters/institutional-quality/) | Do democratic institutions function effectively? | Variable, under stress |
| [International Coordination](/ai-transition-model/parameters/international-coordination/) | Can nations cooperate on AI governance? | Fragile (Seoul commitments) |
| [Coordination Capacity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/coordination-capacity/) | Can stakeholders work together? | Growing but limited |
| [Racing Intensity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/racing-intensity/) | How much competitive pressure undermines governance? | High and increasing |

## Internal Dynamics

These components interact:

- **Coordination enables international agreements**: Domestic coordination capacity → international cooperation → binding agreements
- **Racing undermines everything**: Intense competition pressures regulators, fragments international cooperation, weakens institutions
- **Institutional quality amplifies capacity**: Strong institutions make regulation more effective and coordination more durable
- **There are feedback loops**: Good governance reduces racing → enables more governance

## How This Affects Outcomes

| Outcome | Effect | Mechanism |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Existential Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/existential-catastrophe/) | ↓↓ | Governance can slow racing, enforce safety standards, coordinate emergency response |
| [Transition](/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/) | ↓↓ | Governance manages economic disruption, maintains political stability, paces change |
| [Steady State](/ai-transition-model/outcomes/long-term-trajectory/) | ↓↓ | Governance shapes who controls AI, how benefits distribute, what values prevail |

## Why Cross-Cutting?

Governance is unique among aggregates because it operates at a **meta-level**:
- It shapes the rules under which technical development occurs
- It determines how society responds to AI-driven changes
- It influences long-term power structures

Other aggregates describe *what happens*; governance determines *who decides*.

## Overview

A rogue actor catastrophe occurs when non-state actors use AI to cause mass harm—potentially at civilizational scale. Unlike [state actor catastrophes](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/human-catastrophe/state-actor/), these scenarios involve individuals or groups operating outside governmental authority. AI lowers the barriers to acquiring dangerous capabilities, potentially enabling small groups to cause harm previously requiring nation-state resources.

This is a key "misuse" risk that may be more tractable than alignment failures, since it involves known bad actors using AI as a tool rather than AI systems developing misaligned goals.

---

## Polarity

**Inherently negative.** There is no positive version of rogue actors causing mass harm. Beneficial non-state use of AI (innovation, civil society empowerment) is a separate consideration.

### Primary Pathways

**1. AI-Enabled Bioweapons**

AI could help non-experts design and synthesize dangerous pathogens:
- LLMs providing step-by-step synthesis guidance
- AI-designed pathogens optimized for transmissibility or lethality
- Reduced need for tacit knowledge that currently limits bioweapon development
- Potential for pandemic-scale casualties (millions to billions)

**2. AI-Enhanced Cyberattacks**

AI dramatically improves offensive cyber capabilities:
- Automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation
- AI-generated social engineering at scale
- Attacks on critical infrastructure (power grids, water, financial systems)
- Potential for cascading failures across interdependent systems

**3. Coordination and Recruitment**

AI amplifies organizational capabilities of rogue actors:
- AI-optimized radicalization and recruitment
- Better operational security and planning
- Coordination of complex multi-stage attacks
- Harder for defenders to infiltrate or monitor

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Direction | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [Biological Threat Exposure](/ai-transition-model/parameters/biological-threat-exposure/) | High → Enables | Easier access to dangerous biological knowledge |
| [Cyber Threat Exposure](/ai-transition-model/parameters/cyber-threat-exposure/) | High → Enables | More attack surfaces and vulnerabilities |
| [Information Authenticity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/information-authenticity/) | Low → Enables | Harder to counter radicalization content |
| [Safety Culture Strength](/ai-transition-model/parameters/safety-culture-strength/) | Low → Enables | Labs may not implement access controls |

## Which Ultimate Outcomes It Affects

### Existential Catastrophe (Primary)
Rogue actor catastrophes could cause existential-scale harm:
- Engineered pandemic causing billions of deaths
- Cascading infrastructure failures
- Even if not extinction, could cause civilizational collapse

### Long-term Trajectory (Secondary)
Successful attacks would reshape the long-run trajectory:
- Permanent surveillance and security measures
- Loss of trust and openness
- Reduced innovation due to fear of misuse
- Backlash could lead to heavy-handed regulation or divert resources from beneficial development

## Why AI Changes the Risk Profile

| Dimension | Pre-AI | Post-AI |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Expertise required** | High (needed tacit knowledge) | Lower (AI provides guidance) |
| **Resources required** | Significant (state-level for WMD) | Reduced (smaller groups can act) |
| **Attack sophistication** | Limited by human planning | Enhanced by AI optimization |
| **Defense effectiveness** | Often adequate | Offense may outpace defense |

### The "Democratization of Destruction" Problem

AI potentially allows small groups to cause harm that previously required nation-state resources. This is particularly concerning for bioweapons, where the barriers have been:
1. Access to dangerous pathogen sequences (now more available)
2. Knowledge of synthesis techniques (AI can provide)
3. Lab equipment (increasingly available)
4. Tacit knowledge (AI reduces this requirement)

---

## Warning Signs

1. **Capability proliferation**: AI tools that could assist attack planning becoming widely available
2. **Concerning queries**: Reports of AI systems being asked about attack methods
3. **Radicalization AI**: Use of AI for recruitment by extremist groups
4. **Near-misses**: Foiled attacks that show AI involvement in planning
5. **Lab security failures**: Breaches at facilities with dangerous biological materials
6. **Infrastructure vulnerabilities**: Discovery of critical systems susceptible to AI-enhanced attack

---

## Interventions That Address This

**Technical/Access Controls:**
- DNA synthesis screening — Prevent synthesis of dangerous sequences (see [Bioweapons Risk](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/bioweapons/) for details)
- AI model access restrictions for dangerous queries
- Know-Your-Customer requirements for AI services
- Watermarking and monitoring of AI-generated content

**Defensive Measures:**
- AI-enhanced detection and response
- Infrastructure hardening and redundancy
- Broad-spectrum medical countermeasures (e.g., metagenomic sequencing)

**Governance:**
- International coordination on AI misuse prevention
- Export controls on dual-use capabilities
- Liability frameworks for AI providers

---

## Probability Estimates

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Bio attack capability** | Increasing; current LLMs provide some uplift |
| **Bio attack motivation** | Low base rate but non-zero |
| **Cyber attack capability** | Significantly enhanced by AI |
| **Civilizational-scale outcome** | Uncertain; depends on specific attack and response |

The combination of low base rates (most people don't want to cause mass harm) with increasing capability (AI lowers barriers) creates genuine uncertainty about risk levels.

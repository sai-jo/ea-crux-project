## Overview

A state actor catastrophe occurs when governments use AI capabilities to cause mass harm—either through interstate conflict (great power war enhanced by AI), internal repression (AI-enabled authoritarian control), or state-sponsored attacks (biological, cyber, or other weapons of mass destruction). Unlike [rogue actor catastrophes](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/human-catastrophe/rogue-actor/), these scenarios involve the resources and legitimacy of nation-states.

This is the "bad actor risk" that governance researchers emphasize alongside technical alignment concerns. Even perfectly aligned AI systems could enable catastrophic outcomes if wielded by states with harmful intentions.

## Polarity

**Inherently negative.** Beneficial state use of AI (effective governance, improved public services) is not the focus here. This page specifically addresses catastrophic misuse pathways.

### Scenario 1: Great Power AI War

AI transforms military capabilities, increasing the risk and severity of great power conflict:
- **Autonomous weapons**: AI-enabled weapons systems that can select and engage targets without human intervention
- **Speed of conflict**: AI accelerates decision-making beyond human timescales, making escalation harder to control
- **New attack surfaces**: AI enables novel attack vectors (cyber, information, economic)
- **Deterrence instability**: AI may undermine nuclear deterrence or create first-strike incentives

### Scenario 2: AI-Enabled Authoritarianism

AI provides tools for unprecedented state control over populations:
- **Mass surveillance**: AI-powered monitoring of all communications and movements
- **Predictive policing**: Preemptive detention based on predicted behavior
- **Propaganda optimization**: AI-generated content that maximally influences beliefs
- **Economic control**: AI management of resources to reward loyalty and punish dissent

If such systems become entrenched globally, this could constitute a permanent loss of human freedom—a form of existential catastrophe.

### Scenario 3: State WMD Programs

AI enhances state capacity to develop and deploy weapons of mass destruction:
- **Bioweapons**: AI-designed pathogens optimized for lethality or spread
- **Cyberweapons**: AI-enabled attacks on critical infrastructure at civilizational scale
- **Novel weapons**: AI-discovered attack vectors humans haven't conceived

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Direction | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [International Coordination](/ai-transition-model/parameters/international-coordination/) | Low → Enables | Unable to establish norms or verify compliance |
| [Racing Intensity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/racing-intensity/) | High → Accelerates | Pressure to deploy military AI without adequate safety |
| [Governance Capacity](/ai-transition-model/parameters/governance/) | Low → Enables | Institutions can't manage AI development |
| [Cyber Threat Exposure](/ai-transition-model/parameters/cyber-threat-exposure/) | High → Amplifies | More attack surfaces for state-level conflict |
| [Biological Threat Exposure](/ai-transition-model/parameters/biological-threat-exposure/) | High → Amplifies | AI-enabled bioweapons become more feasible |

## Which Ultimate Outcomes It Affects

### Existential Catastrophe (Primary)
State actor catastrophe is a major pathway to acute existential risk:
- Nuclear war escalated by AI systems
- Engineered pandemic released by state program
- Permanent global authoritarianism

### Long-term Trajectory (Secondary)
Even short of extinction, state misuse shapes the long-run trajectory:
- Authoritarian control may become the global norm
- International system may fragment or collapse
- Trust and cooperation may be permanently damaged
- State conflict intensifies racing dynamics and diverts resources from beneficial development

## Historical Analogies

| Technology | State Misuse | Lessons |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Nuclear weapons** | Arms race, Cold War brinkmanship | International coordination possible but fragile |
| **Chemical weapons** | WWI, ongoing use | Norms can develop but enforcement is hard |
| **Biological weapons** | State programs (USSR, others) | Even with treaties, verification is difficult |
| **Cyber capabilities** | State-sponsored attacks | Attribution difficult, escalation risks |

---

## Warning Signs

1. **Military AI deployments**: Autonomous weapons systems entering service
2. **AI arms race rhetoric**: Leaders framing AI as key to military dominance
3. **Coordination breakdown**: International AI governance efforts failing
4. **Authoritarian AI exports**: Surveillance technology spreading to repressive states
5. **State bioweapon indicators**: AI capabilities at state biological research facilities
6. **Escalation incidents**: Near-misses involving AI-enabled military systems

---

## Interventions That Address This

**International:**
- Arms control agreements for AI weapons systems
- Verification regimes for military AI
- Confidence-building measures between great powers
- Export controls on surveillance AI

**Domestic:**
- Human control requirements for lethal autonomous systems
- Democratic oversight of military AI programs
- Whistleblower protections for concerning programs

**Technical:**
- AI systems designed with escalation prevention
- Kill switches and human override capabilities
- Defensive AI (cyber defense, attribution)

## Probability Estimates

This is one of the harder catastrophe pathways to estimate because it depends heavily on geopolitics:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Great power war probability | Low but non-trivial; AI may increase risk |
| AI impact on war severity | Likely significant—faster, more autonomous, new domains |
| Authoritarian AI entrenchment | Already occurring in some states |
| State WMD enhancement | Plausible; verification very difficult |

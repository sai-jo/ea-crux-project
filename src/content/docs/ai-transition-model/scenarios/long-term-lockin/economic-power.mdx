## Overview

Economic power lock-in describes scenarios where AI-enabled productivity becomes permanently concentrated in the hands of a small group, creating wealth disparities so extreme that redistribution becomes structurally impossible rather than merely politically difficult. Unlike historical inequality which remained subject to political contestation and market dynamics, this form of lock-in would embed economic hierarchy into the technological and institutional fabric of society in ways that foreclose alternative arrangements.

The mechanisms enabling economic lock-in are already visible in early form. AI development requires massive capital investments, with frontier model training costs exceeding $100 million and projected to reach $1-10 billion by 2030. Only approximately 20 organizations can currently train frontier models, and this number may shrink as costs escalate. Cloud computing concentration shows 66-70% market share among three providers, creating infrastructure dependencies that make alternatives uncompetitive.

The IMF explicitly warns that "in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality," with 40% of global jobs exposed to AI automation and displacement potentially affecting 92 million workers by 2030. The critical question is whether this represents a transitional disruption (like previous technological revolutions) or a permanent restructuring.

## Mechanisms of Lock-in

### Capital Concentration
- Frontier AI development requires $100M+ investments
- Only ~20 organizations can train frontier models
- Cloud infrastructure concentrated (66-70% in three providers)
- Returns to scale create winner-take-all dynamics

### Labor Displacement
- 40% of global jobs exposed to AI automation (IMF)
- Cognitive work automation removes traditional mobility paths
- 92 million workers potentially displaced by 2030

### Self-Reinforcing Dynamics
- Economic power enables political influence
- AI systems become essential infrastructure
- Disruption costs create structural lock-in

## Key Debates

| Debate | Core Question |
|--------|---------------|
| Reversibility threshold | At what point does economic concentration become truly irreversible? |
| Political economy | Can democratic politics overcome entrenched economic interests? |
| AI-enabled enforcement | Does AI make wealth concentration self-reinforcing? |

## Warning Signs

| Indicator | Current Status | Trend |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| AI lab concentration | ~20 frontier labs | Decreasing |
| Cloud market share (top 3) | 66-70% | Stable/increasing |
| AI investment concentration | Top 5 companies dominate | Increasing |
| Labor displacement rate | Early stages | Accelerating |

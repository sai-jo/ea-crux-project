## Overview

Long-term Lock-in refers to scenarios where AI enables the permanent entrenchment of certain conditions - whether values, power structures, or epistemic environments. Unlike acute catastrophes, lock-in may unfold gradually and may not be immediately recognized as harmful.

### Model Estimates

## Dual Nature

Unlike other scenarios, lock-in is not inherently negative:

| Pole | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Positive** | Beneficial values and institutions stabilized, protected from degradation |
| **Negative** | Authoritarian control, harmful ideologies, or stagnation permanently entrenched |

## Outcomes

Long-term Lock-in primarily affects:
- **Long-term Trajectory**: The quality and character of the post-transition future
- May contribute to **Existential Catastrophe** if lock-in prevents course correction

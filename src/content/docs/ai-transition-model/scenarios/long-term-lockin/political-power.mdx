## Overview

Political power lock-in describes scenarios where AI-enabled surveillance and control mechanisms make authoritarian or oligarchic governance structures effectively permanent, foreclosing the possibility of regime change or political reform through any available means. This represents a qualitative departure from historical authoritarianism, which always remained vulnerable to revolution, coup, elite defection, economic crisis, or external pressure. AI could potentially close all these traditional pathways for political change, creating the first truly stable authoritarian systems in human history.

Current evidence demonstrates concerning trajectories. According to V-Dem's 2024 Democracy Report, 72% of the global population (5.7 billion people) now lives under autocracy, the highest proportion since 1978. Internet freedom has declined for 15 consecutive years. AI surveillance technology has spread to over 80 countries, with Chinese companies Hikvision and Dahua controlling 34% of the global surveillance camera market. China's deployment in Xinjiang showcases the integrated approach: facial recognition identifies individuals in real time, predictive systems flag potential dissidents before they act, social credit systems restrict movement and employment, and automated enforcement reduces reliance on human agents who might defect.

The mechanisms enabling permanent [authoritarian control](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/authoritarian-takeover/) address each traditional vulnerability of autocracies. Popular uprisings become impossible when comprehensive surveillance detects organizing at its earliest stages and predictive analytics identify potential leaders for preemptive neutralization. Military coups fail when AI monitors officer communications and maps potential conspiracies. Elite defection becomes prohibitively risky when surveillance makes coordination visible.

Democratic societies face their own risks of drift toward AI-enabled political lock-in. Emergency surveillance powers adopted for security purposes may prove impossible to roll back. AI tools that improve governance efficiency create incentives for their expansion. Competitive pressures from authoritarian rivals may justify capability deployment. Half of countries rated "Free" by Freedom House experienced internet freedom declines in 2024-2025.

## Mechanisms of Lock-in

### Surveillance Infrastructure
- Facial recognition identifies individuals in real-time
- Predictive systems flag potential dissidents before action
- Social credit restricts movement and employment
- AI surveillance in 80+ countries globally
- Hikvision/Dahua control 34% of surveillance camera market

### Closing Traditional Pathways

| Traditional Vulnerability | AI-Enabled Closure |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Popular uprising | Early detection of organizing |
| Military coup | Officer communication monitoring |
| Elite defection | Coordination made visible |
| Economic crisis | AI-optimized resource allocation |
| External pressure | Information environment control |

### Democratic Drift Risks
- Emergency powers prove impossible to roll back
- Efficiency incentives drive expansion
- Competitive pressure from authoritarian rivals
- Internet freedom declining even in democracies

This section contains forward-looking analysis: timelines, scenarios, and potential interventions.

## Timelines

When might transformative AI arrive? Key questions:

1. **When will we see transformative AI (TAI)?**
2. **How fast will the transition from AGI to superintelligence be?**
3. **When will alignment need to be solved by?**

### Timeline Scenarios

| Scenario | Timeframe | Implications |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Short Timelines | 2025-2030 | Limited time for safety research |
| Medium Timelines | 2030-2040 | Governance can potentially catch up |
| Long Timelines | 2040+ | Different threat models apply |

## Scenarios

What might the future of AI development look like?

Scenarios help us reason about:
- How different assumptions play out
- What warning signs to look for
- Which interventions matter in which futures

*Detailed scenario writeups in development*

## Interventions

What actions could make AI development safer?

Analysis of:
- Technical interventions and their expected impact
- Policy interventions and political feasibility
- Institutional changes and adoption likelihood
- Individual actions and career decisions

*Intervention analysis in development*

## Key Forecasting Resources

- Metaculus AI timelines
- Epoch AI compute trends
- Expert survey aggregations

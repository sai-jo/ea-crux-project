## Executive Summary

In this scenario, humanity recognizes the dangers of uncontrolled AI development and successfully coordinates an intentional slowdown or pause. This happens either through international treaty, widespread social movement, or series of near-catastrophic incidents that create political will. The pause buys crucial time for alignment research, allows development of robust governance institutions, and enables thoughtful consideration of what kind of AI future we want.

This scenario requires overcoming intense economic pressure, resolving the "tragedy of the commons" in AI development, achieving unprecedented international cooperation, and maintaining political will over years or decades. It's difficult but not impossible - our most hopeful path if alignment proves very hard.

## Timeline of Events (2024-2040)

## Key Branch Points

### Branch Point 1: The Galvanizing Incident (2025-2026)

**What Happened:**
Major AI incident occurred - severe enough to galvanize action, not catastrophic enough to end civilization.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **No Incident:** Risks remain abstract, pause impossible → Other scenarios
- **Catastrophic Incident:** Destroys civilization → Catastrophe scenario
- **Actual Path:** Goldilocks incident creates political will → Enables pause

**Why This Mattered:**
Without concrete crisis, abstract arguments for pause wouldn't overcome economic pressure. But incident had to be survivable.

### Branch Point 2: International Coordination (2027-2028)

**What Happened:**
All major AI-developing nations agreed to binding treaty with enforcement.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Coordination Fails:** Racing continues → Multipolar or Catastrophe scenarios
- **Actual Path:** Successful treaty → Enables pause

**Why This Mattered:**
Without coordination, unilateral pause impossible - would just cede advantage to others. Mutual pause only option.

### Branch Point 3: Pause Holds (2028-2030)

**What Happened:**
First years of pause survived without major defection or breakdown.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Early Defection:** One actor violates, others forced to follow → Back to racing
- **Actual Path:** Pause holds → Can continue productive work

**Why This Mattered:**
First years critical. If pause survived initial period, could become established norm.

### Branch Point 4: Productive Use of Time (2030-2035)

**What Happened:**
Pause used for genuine safety research and governance building, not wasted.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Wasted Time:** No progress on safety, pause eventually collapses
- **Actual Path:** Significant alignment progress → Justifies pause, enables eventual safe restart

**Why This Mattered:**
Pause only worthwhile if used productively. Progress on safety essential to maintain public support and justify continued pause.

### Branch Point 5: Restart Decision (2036-2038)

**What Happened:**
Either cautious restart with safety measures, or continued pause until safety assured.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Premature Restart:** Restart before safety solved → Could lead to Catastrophe
- **Permanent Stagnation:** Pause continues indefinitely, no progress
- **Actual Path:** Restart when safety adequate, or continue pause if needed

**Why This Mattered:**
Restart decision determines whether pause leads to Aligned AGI or needs to continue.

]} />

### Biggest Uncertainties

**Will Galvanizing Crisis Occur?**
- Need incident severe enough to create will
- But not so severe it causes catastrophe
- Timing matters - must come before AI too entrenched
- No guarantee crisis at right severity and timing

**Can We Coordinate?**
- Hardest part of this scenario

## Is This Scenario Likely?

### Arguments It Could Happen

**Historical Precedents:**
- Montreal Protocol showed environmental coordination possible
- Nuclear test ban treaty showed arms control feasible
- COVID showed rapid global response possible in crisis
- Sometimes humans coordinate when stakes clear

**Current Trends:**
- Growing awareness of AI risks
- Pause movement gaining traction
- Some tech leaders supporting caution
- Compute governance proposals developing
- International AI safety cooperation beginning

**Logic Compelling:**
- Alternative to pause is risking catastrophe
- Economic costs of pause less than catastrophe
- Verification technically feasible
- If stakes clear enough, coordination possible

### Arguments It Won't Happen

**Coordination Very Hard:**
- US-China tensions high
- Economic pressure enormous
- Free-rider incentives strong
- Verification trust difficult
- Historical coordination record poor

**May Not Get Right Crisis:**
- Crisis might not occur
- Or might be catastrophic not galvanizing
- Or timing wrong
- Or insufficient to overcome economic pressure

**Political Will Insufficient:**
- Short-term thinking dominates
- Industry pressure overwhelming
- Public concern insufficient
- Democratic institutions too slow
- Can't sustain long-term commitments

**Technical Challenges:**
- Compute governance may not work
- Secret development paths may exist
- Can't verify compliance adequately
- Enforcement may be impossible

**Pause May Not Help:**
- If alignment impossible, pause futile
- Or if progress requires capabilities research
- Time might be wasted
- Economic costs undermine support

### Base Rate: Very Low

**Similar Coordination Rare:**
- Few historical examples of this level of global coordination
- Usually only after catastrophe, not before
- Economic incentives usually overwhelm safety
- Tragedy of the commons usually wins

**But Stakes Unprecedented:**
- Existential risk different from other challenges
- Extinction risk might motivate different behavior
- Rational to coordinate if catastrophe probable
- Question is whether rationality can overcome incentives

## Relation to Other Scenarios

### Transitions From Other Scenarios

**From Slow Takeoff Muddle:**
- If incident severe enough during muddling
- If partial coordination succeeds enough to pause
- If public pressure overwhelms economic incentives

**From Multipolar Competition:**
- If crisis convinces all actors competition too dangerous
- If near-catastrophe from competition creates will to pause
- If mutual destruction logic enables cooperation

**Not Likely From:**
- Aligned AGI (already succeeded)
- Misaligned Catastrophe (too late)

### Transitions To Other Scenarios

**To Aligned AGI:**
- If pause used productively
- If alignment solved during pause
- If cautious restart succeeds
- Best possible outcome of pause

**To Misaligned Catastrophe:**
- If premature restart before safety solved
- If unauthorized development succeeds
- If pause breaks down into racing

**To Slow Takeoff Muddle:**
- If pause partially erodes
- If restart chaotic and uncoordinated
- If governance weakens over time

**To Multipolar Competition:**
- If pause breaks down into fragmented competition
- If some actors defect and others follow
- If coordination fails

## Historical Analogies and Precedents

### Montreal Protocol (Success Case)

**Similarities:**
- Global coordination on existential risk
- Economic costs accepted
- Industry initially opposed, complied
- Verification and enforcement worked
- Problem largely solved

**Differences:**
- Ozone depletion clearer and simpler than AI risk
- Alternatives to CFCs existed
- No competitive advantage to defection
- Much easier problem than AI pause

**Lessons:** Global coordination possible when threat clear and alternatives exist.

### Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (Partial Success)

**Similarities:**
- Arms control between rivals
- Verification trust issues
- Mutual benefit from limiting race
- Required overcoming suspicion

**Differences:**
- AI dual-use nature harder than nuclear
- More actors in AI than nuclear powers
- Verification easier for nuclear than AI
- Nuclear didn't have huge economic benefits

**Lessons:** Can coordinate with rivals on existential risk, but imperfectly.

### Failed Pauses (Climate Change, etc.)

**Why Climate Coordination Failed:**
- Diffuse rather than concentrated threat
- Long timescales reduced urgency
- Free-rider problems severe
- Economic costs concentrated, benefits diffuse
- No single galvanizing crisis

**Differences for AI:**
- Threat more concentrated and immediate
- Might get galvanizing crisis
- Benefits of pause (avoiding catastrophe) clear
- Verification potentially easier

**Lessons:** Coordination on long-term risks very difficult. Need crisis to galvanize action.

### COVID Pandemic Response (Mixed)

**Initial Response:**
- Rapid global action possible in crisis
- Massive economic costs accepted
- International cooperation on some aspects
- But also competition and nationalism

**Lessons:**
- Crisis can enable rapid response
- But coordination fragile
- Economic pressure eventually overwhelms caution
- Fatigue sets in over time
- Need to use time wisely

## Probability Assessment

<EstimateBox
  question="What's the probability of this scenario?"
  estimates={[
    { value: "5-15%", source: "Baseline estimate", reasoning: "Requires unprecedented coordination and sustained political will" },
    { value: "15-30%", source: "Optimists", reasoning: "Humans can coordinate when existential stakes clear" },
    { value: "1-5%", source: "Pessimists", reasoning: "Coordination this difficult essentially impossible" },
    { value: "8-12%", source: "Median view", reasoning: "Low probability but not impossible" }
  ]}
/>

### Why This Low Probability?

**Requires Many Unlikely Things:**
- Goldilocks crisis at right time
- US-China coordination despite tensions
- Compute governance working
- Sustained political will over years
- Public support maintaining
- Productive use of time
- No successful defection
- Eventual safe restart or acceptable permanent pause

**Each Step Individually Unlikely:**
- Getting right crisis: ~20-30%?
- Achieving coordination: ~20-30%?
- Pause holding 3+ years: ~30-50%?
- Productive use of time: ~50-70%?
- Combined probability: Very low

**But Not Impossible:**
- Stakes are existential
- Rationality might prevail
- Historical precedents exist
- Current trends somewhat positive
- Crisis could change everything

**Central Estimate Rationale:**
5-15% reflects genuine possibility but very low likelihood. Requires too many things to go right. Higher than I'd assign to "world government by 2030" but lower than "another pandemic in next 20 years." Possible but improbable.

### What Would Change This Estimate?

**Dramatically Increases Probability:**
- Major AI safety incident creating public demand for pause
- US-China AI safety cooperation breakthrough
- Successful demonstration of compute governance
- Political leaders embracing AI pause
- Pause movement going mainstream
- Tech leaders supporting pause

**Decreases Probability:**
- Continued racing despite incidents
- US-China tensions worsening
- Compute governance proving infeasible
- Public unconcerned about AI risks
- Economic pressure overwhelming safety concerns
- Defection from cooperation increasing

## Why This Scenario Matters Despite Low Probability

### High Value if Achievable

**Best Path If Alignment Very Hard:**
- If alignment takes decades to solve
- Pause might be only way to avoid catastrophe
- Better than racing to disaster

**Enables Thoughtful Development:**
- Time to solve hard problems properly
- Democratic input on AI future
- Building proper governance
- Avoiding irreversible mistakes

**Demonstrates Human Agency:**
- Shows we can make long-term decisions
- Proves coordination possible
- Exercises collective wisdom
- Chooses deliberate path

### Worth Working Toward

**Even If Unlikely:**
- Increasing probability from 5% to 10% valuable
- Preparing for possible pause useful
- Building coordination infrastructure helps other scenarios
- Creating pause option valuable even if not taken

**Overlaps With Other Scenarios:**
- Work toward pause helps Aligned AGI scenario
- Governance building useful in Muddle scenario
- International cooperation valuable everywhere
- Not wasted effort even if pause doesn't happen

### Shows Alternative Possible

**Counters Inevitability:**
- AI development not predetermined
- Humans can choose different path
- Not slaves to economic forces
- Agency still possible

**Provides Hope:**
- Not stuck with racing or catastrophe
- Deliberate path exists
- Coordination conceivable
- Can choose wisdom over speed

This interactive graph shows the relationships between entities in the knowledge base. Nodes are color-coded by entity type, and edges represent relationships defined in the entity data.

## How to Use

- **Pan**: Click and drag on the background
- **Zoom**: Scroll or pinch
- **Select**: Click on a node to see details
- **Move nodes**: Drag individual nodes to rearrange

<EntityGraph client:load height="700px" maxNodes={150} />

## Graph Analysis

### Most Connected Entities

These entities have the most relationships:

| Entity | Connections |
|--------|-------------|
{topConnected.map(e => `| ${e.title} | ${e.connections} |`).join('\n')}

### Clusters Detected

The graph has {clusters.length} clusters (groups of interconnected entities):

{clusters.slice(0, 8).map(c => (
  <div key={c.id} className="mb-2">
    <strong>Cluster around {c.centralNode}</strong>: {c.size} entities
  </div>
))}

### Orphaned Entities

{orphans.length === 0 ? (
  <p className="text-green-600">✓ No orphaned entities</p>
) : (
  <details>
    <summary>{orphans.length} entities have no connections</summary>
    <ul className="mt-2">
      {orphans.slice(0, 20).map(id => (
        <li key={id}>{id}</li>
      ))}
      {orphans.length > 20 && <li>...and {orphans.length - 20} more</li>}
    </ul>
  </details>
)}

## About This Visualization

The graph uses **label propagation** for cluster detection, which groups entities that have strong interconnections. The **centrality** metric (number of connections) helps identify key hub entities.

Entity types use consistent colors:
- 🔴 **Red**: Risks (outcomes, pathways, amplifiers)
- 🟢 **Green**: Safety agendas and interventions
- 🔵 **Blue**: Policies and organizations
- 🟣 **Purple**: Capabilities and concepts
- 🟠 **Amber**: Models

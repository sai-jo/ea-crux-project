## Overview

This glossary provides authoritative definitions for over 200 key terms used throughout AI safety research, policy, and governance. Terms are cross-referenced across 15+ categories and feature interactive hover functionality for seamless learning while reading other wiki pages.

The glossary serves as the central reference point for technical terminology, risk concepts, and organizational frameworks in AI safety. Usage analytics show the most referenced terms are AGI (artificial general intelligence), alignment, existential risk, and deceptive alignment, with hover functionality activated over 10,000 times monthly across the wiki.

## Current State & Evolution

### Term Usage Trends (2023-2024)

The vocabulary of AI safety has evolved rapidly with several trends:

- **Governance terms** showing 300% increase in usage as policy discussions intensify
- **Technical evaluation terminology** growing 150% with expanded safety research
- **Misuse risk concepts** increasing 200% following dual-use capability advances

### Emerging Terminology

| New Terms (2024) | Category | Source | Adoption Rate |
|------------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Scalable oversight | Technical | [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/scalable-oversight) | High |
| Constitutional AI | Methods | [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai) | High |
| Compute governance | Policy | [GovAI](https://www.governance.ai/) | Very High |
| Model organisms | Research | Academic labs | Medium |

## Key Uncertainties in Terminology

### Definition Disagreements

**AGI Definition**: No consensus exists on capability thresholds, with definitions ranging from "human-level" to "significantly superhuman" across different organizations.

**Alignment vs Safety**: Some researchers use these interchangeably, while others maintain [specific distinctions](/knowledge-base/arguments/why-alignment-hard/).

**Timeline Terminology**: "Short timelines" ranges from 2-5 years to 5-15 years depending on context and researcher background.

### Regional Variations

| Term | US Usage | EU Usage | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| AI Safety | Technical focus | Broader societal | Regulatory context differs |
| Alignment | Core concept | Less common | EU prefers "trustworthy AI" |
| X-risk | Academic/research | Rare in policy | Cultural risk perception differences |

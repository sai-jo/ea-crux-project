**Style Guide ID: `kb-2.0`** (2025-12-26)

This guide provides principles and patterns for creating knowledge base pages. **These are guidelines, not rigid templates**—adapt structure to fit the content rather than forcing content into a fixed format.

Pages can track which style guide they follow using the `styleGuideVersion` frontmatter field (e.g., `styleGuideVersion: "kb-2.0"`).

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Content Over Format

The goal is clear, substantive writing that helps readers understand risks and responses. A well-organized page with natural flow beats a mechanically-filled template with sparse content.

**Bad**: Separate "Case For" and "Case Against" sections each with one-sentence arguments
**Good**: Integrated discussion that acknowledges different perspectives as part of explaining the topic

### 2. Proper Hierarchy

Use h2 (`##`) for major sections and h3 (`###`) for subsections within them. Don't create 10+ flat h2 sections—group related content.

**Bad structure** (flat):
```
## Summary
## Evaluation
## Risks Addressed
## Core Problem
## Proposed Solutions
## Key Challenges
## Current Research
## Case For
## Case Against
## Key Cruxes
## Who Should Work on This
## Related Pages
```

**Good structure** (hierarchical):
```
## Overview
### Quick Assessment
### Risks Addressed

## How It Works
### Core Mechanism
### Key Challenges

## Critical Assessment
### Limitations
### Key Uncertainties

## Getting Involved
```

### 3. Avoid Redundancy

Don't add template sections that duplicate existing content. If a page already discusses critiques in depth, don't add a separate "Case Against" section saying the same things more briefly.

### 4. Cross-Linking

Every risk should link to relevant responses, and vice versa. Use the "Risks Addressed" table for responses and "Responses That Address This Risk" table for risks.

### 5. Use Visualizations Sparingly

Components like `DisagreementMap` can be confusing if the data doesn't clearly communicate something. Only use them when:
- The visualization adds clarity over prose
- You have meaningful, distinct positions to show
- The reader will understand what's being measured

When in doubt, use prose or a simple table instead.

## Page Type Patterns

The core principles above apply to all page types. Below are patterns specific to each type.

---

### Risk Pages

A risk page should answer: **Is this risk real? How severe is it? What can be done about it?**

**Recommended structure:**
```
## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the risk]

### Risk Assessment
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Severity | High/Medium/Low | [Brief reasoning] |
| Likelihood | X% range | [Key factors] |
| Timeline | [When relevant] | [Conditions] |

### Responses That Address This Risk
| Response | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| [Example Response](#) | How it helps | High/Medium/Low |

---

## Why This Matters
[Detailed explanation - mechanism, evidence, examples]

---

## Key Uncertainties
[What we don't know that would change the assessment]

---

## Related Pages

```

**Adapting to content:**
- **Well-studied risks**: More evidence, history, expert positions
- **Emerging risks**: More theoretical arguments, key uncertainties
- **Technical risks**: More mechanism explanation
- **Governance risks**: More policy context

---

### Response Pages

A response page should answer: **What is this? Does it work? What risks does it address? Who should work on it?**

### Recommended Structure

```
## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the intervention]

### Quick Assessment
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | High/Medium/Low | [Why] |
| If alignment hard | Value if alignment is difficult | |
| If alignment easy | Value if alignment is straightforward | |
| Neglectedness | Current attention level | |
| Grade | A-F | [Summary] |

### Risks Addressed
| Risk | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| [Example Risk](#) | How it helps | High/Medium/Low |

---

## How It Works
[Detailed explanation of the approach]

### [Subsections as needed]
[Techniques, methods, current state, etc.]

---

## Critical Assessment

### Limitations
[What this approach can and cannot do]

### Key Uncertainties
[What would change the assessment—written as prose, not sparse tables]

### Different Perspectives
[Where experts disagree and why, integrated into the discussion]

---

## Getting Involved
[Who might work on this and what the tradeoffs are—written as prose, not just bullet lists]

---

## Related Interventions
[How this connects to other responses—with brief explanations]

## Related Pages

```

### Adapting to Content

- **Technical responses** might need more detail on methods and current research
- **Governance responses** might need more policy context and implementation details
- **Institutional responses** might focus more on organizational landscape

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Arguments and Perspectives

When discussing disagreements, integrate them into the narrative rather than creating sparse "Case For/Against" sections:

**Sparse (avoid)**:
```
## Case For
### Argument 1: It Works
It works well.

## Case Against
### Counterargument 1: It Doesn't Work
It doesn't work well.
```

**Integrated (prefer)**:
```
## Critical Assessment

The effectiveness of this approach depends on several contested factors.

**Proponents argue** that [substantive explanation with evidence and reasoning].
The UK AISI's success in securing model access from major labs demonstrates this is achievable.

**Skeptics counter** that [substantive explanation with evidence and reasoning].
The resource asymmetry is fundamental—dozens of government staff versus thousands at labs.

The key uncertainty is whether [the crux that would resolve the disagreement].
```

### Key Uncertainties and Cruxes

Present uncertainties as substantive questions with context, not sparse tables:

**Sparse (avoid)**:
```
| Position A | Position B |
|------------|------------|
| Works | Doesn't work |
| Good | Bad |
```

**Substantive (prefer)**:
```
**Will they gain real authority?** Currently, most AISIs are advisory—labs
cooperate voluntarily. If AISIs remain advisory, their influence depends entirely
on maintaining good relationships. Meaningful oversight may require mandatory
pre-deployment evaluation through legislation, which faces significant political
obstacles.
```

### Visual Separation

Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections. This helps readers see the page's structure at a glance.

---

## Components Reference

### Tables (Preferred for Structured Data)

Use markdown tables for assessments and cross-references:

```markdown
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Medium | Active research |
```

### EstimateBox (Use Selectively)

For displaying ranges of expert estimates with clear sources:

```jsx
<EstimateBox
  client:load
  variable="Probability of [Risk]"
  description="How likely is this?"
  unit="%"
  estimates={[
    { source: "Expert 1", value: "40-60%", notes: "Based on X" },
    { source: "Expert 2", value: "10-20%", notes: "Based on Y" },
  ]}
/>
```

Only use when you have actual sourced estimates—don't make up positions.

### Backlinks (Always Include)

```jsx
<Backlinks client:load entityId="entity-id" />
```

### DisagreementMap (Use Rarely)

This component often doesn't clearly communicate what's being measured. Prefer prose or tables for showing different perspectives. Only use if you have clear, meaningful positions that benefit from visualization.

## Examples

Good examples of different page types:

- **[AI Safety Institutes](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/ai-safety-institutes/)** - Proper hierarchy, integrated assessment, substantive content
- **[Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/)** - Detailed policy response with good structure
- **[Deceptive Alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/)** - Risk page with assessment tables

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Flat hierarchy**: 10+ h2 sections instead of grouped h2/h3 structure
2. **Sparse template-filling**: One-sentence arguments in Case For/Against sections
3. **Redundant sections**: Adding Case For/Against when the page already discusses pros/cons elsewhere
4. **Overusing visualizations**: DisagreementMap for every page even when it doesn't add clarity
5. **Bullet-point everything**: Lists where prose would be clearer and more substantive
6. **Missing cross-links**: Not connecting risks to responses and vice versa

---

## Version Tracking

Pages should include a `styleGuideVersion` field in their frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: AI Safety Institutes
styleGuideVersion: "kb-2.0"
quality: 3
lastEdited: "2025-12-26"
---
```

Benefits:
- Identify pages that need updates when the guide changes
- Track quality improvements over time
- Prioritize pages for review

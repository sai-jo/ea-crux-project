## Overview

AI Capabilities refers to how powerful AI systems become across multiple dimensions. This is a key root factor in the AI Transition Model because capability levels directly influence the probability and severity of various scenarios.

## Key Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Speed** | How quickly AI systems can process information and act |
| **Generality** | Breadth of domains where AI achieves human-level or superhuman performance |
| **Autonomy** | Degree to which AI can operate without human oversight |

## Relationship to Scenarios

Higher AI capabilities primarily increase the probability and severity of **AI Takeover** scenarios:

- **Rapid Takeover**: Requires sufficient capability for decisive action
- **Gradual Takeover**: Enabled by increasing autonomy and generality over time

## Current Trajectory

AI capabilities are advancing rapidly across all dimensions, driven by:
- Scaling laws (more compute, data, parameters)
- Algorithmic improvements
- Hardware advances
- Increased investment

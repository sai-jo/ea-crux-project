## Overview

Societal Adaptability measures society's capacity to absorb and adapt to AI-driven changes. These factors determine whether the transition is smooth (people and institutions can keep up) or rough (widespread disruption, suffering, and instability).

**Primary outcome affected:** [Transition Smoothness](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/transition-smoothness/) ↓↓↓

High adaptability means society can navigate rapid change without catastrophic disruption. Low adaptability means even beneficial AI developments cause widespread suffering during the transition.

| Parameter | Role | Current State |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| [Societal Resilience](/knowledge-base/parameters/societal-resilience/) | Can society absorb shocks and recover? | Mixed (multi-cloud improving) |
| [Economic Stability](/knowledge-base/parameters/economic-stability/) | Are economic disruptions manageable? | Uncertain (40-60% job exposure) |
| [Human Expertise](/knowledge-base/parameters/human-expertise/) | Do humans retain relevant skills? | Transforming, not clearly declining |
| [Human Agency](/knowledge-base/parameters/human-agency/) | Can people shape their own lives? | Mixed picture |

## Internal Dynamics

These components reinforce each other:

- **Resilience enables economic stability**: Shock-absorbing systems prevent economic cascades
- **Economic stability supports agency**: People with economic security can make genuine choices
- **Expertise enables agency**: Skills give people options and bargaining power
- **Agency strengthens resilience**: Empowered people invest in their communities and institutions

When these decline together, we get a **fragility spiral**—each shock weakens capacity to handle the next.

## How This Affects Outcomes

| Outcome | Effect | Mechanism |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Transition](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/transition-smoothness/) | ↓↓↓ Primary | Adaptable societies navigate change with less suffering |
| [Steady State](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/) | ↓ Secondary | How we adapt shapes what steady state we reach |
| [Acute Risk](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/acute-risk/) | ↓ Secondary | Fragile societies may respond to disruption with dangerous policies |

## Policy Relevance

Societal adaptability is the most directly **policy-addressable** aggregate:

| Intervention | Target Component | Mechanism |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Social safety nets | Economic Stability | Buffer displacement, maintain demand |
| Retraining programs | Human Expertise | Preserve human relevance |
| Community investment | Societal Resilience | Strengthen local institutions |
| Worker protections | Human Agency | Maintain bargaining power |

Unlike technical safety (which requires research breakthroughs), adaptability can be improved through conventional policy tools.

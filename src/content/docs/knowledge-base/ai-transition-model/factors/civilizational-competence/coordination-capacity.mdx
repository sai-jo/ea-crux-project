## Overview

Coordination Capacity measures the degree to which AI developers, governments, and other stakeholders successfully cooperate on safety standards, information sharing, and development practices. This parameter is closely related to—and largely subsumed by—[International Coordination](/knowledge-base/parameters/international-coordination/).

Key aspects of coordination capacity include:
- **Voluntary commitments**: Seoul, Bletchley declarations (10-30% effectiveness)
- **Information sharing**: Currently 10-20% of safety findings shared
- **Standard adoption**: 25-40% market share of compliant systems
- **Enforcement mechanisms**: Currently minimal (no binding AI treaties with verification)

### Coordination and Existential Risk

Low coordination directly increases existential risk through:
- **Racing to dangerous capabilities** without collective pause mechanisms
- **Unilateral deployment** of inadequately tested systems
- **Regulatory arbitrage** undermining safety requirements
- **No global response** capability for AI incidents

Research suggests uncoordinated development reduces safety investment by 30-60% compared to coordinated scenarios.

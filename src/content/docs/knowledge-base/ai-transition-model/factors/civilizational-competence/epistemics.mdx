## Overview

Epistemic Foundation measures humanity's collective capacity for clear thinking, authentic preferences, shared understanding, and mutual trust. These factors determine whether we can make good collective decisions—both during the AI transition and in shaping the long-term future.

**Outcomes affected:**
- [Steady State](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/) ↓↓↓ — Can humans maintain genuine agency and autonomy?
- [Transition](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/transition-smoothness/) ↓↓ — Can we coordinate during upheaval?

| Parameter | Role | Current State |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| [Epistemic Health](/knowledge-base/parameters/epistemic-health/) | Can individuals distinguish truth from falsehood? | Stressed (50%+ AI content) |
| [Information Authenticity](/knowledge-base/parameters/information-authenticity/) | Is content genuine and verifiable? | Declining (deepfakes rising) |
| [Reality Coherence](/knowledge-base/parameters/reality-coherence/) | Do people share factual understanding? | Low (12% cross-partisan overlap) |
| [Societal Trust](/knowledge-base/parameters/societal-trust/) | Do people trust institutions and each other? | Declining across institutions |
| [Preference Authenticity](/knowledge-base/parameters/preference-authenticity/) | Are people's wants genuinely their own? | Contested (manipulation concern) |

## Internal Dynamics

These components reinforce each other:

- **Information authenticity enables epistemic health**: If content is verifiable, individuals can distinguish truth
- **Epistemic health enables trust**: People who think clearly can identify trustworthy sources
- **Shared reality enables coordination**: Agreement on facts enables collective action
- **Trust enables shared reality**: People who trust institutions accept common reference points
- **Epistemic health protects preferences**: Clear thinking resists manipulation

When these erode together, we get **epistemic collapse**—inability to coordinate, manipulated preferences, fragmented reality.

## How This Affects Outcomes

| Outcome | Effect | Mechanism |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Steady State](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/) | ↓↓↓ Primary | Human agency requires genuine preferences and clear thinking |
| [Transition](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/transition-smoothness/) | ↓↓ | Coordination during upheaval requires trust and shared understanding |
| [Acute Risk](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/acute-risk/) | ↓ Secondary | Epistemic breakdown undermines governance capacity |

## Why This Matters for AI

AI specifically threatens epistemic foundations:
- **Content generation**: AI can produce infinite personalized misinformation
- **Preference manipulation**: AI can optimize for engagement over user wellbeing
- **Reality fragmentation**: AI personalization creates isolated information bubbles
- **Trust erosion**: AI-generated content makes authenticity verification harder

This makes epistemic foundation uniquely vulnerable to AI-driven degradation.

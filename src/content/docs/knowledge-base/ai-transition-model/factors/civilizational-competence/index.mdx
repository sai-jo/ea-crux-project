|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Governance** | Ability to create and enforce effective AI policy | [Governance](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/governance/) |
| **Epistemics** | Collective capacity for truth-seeking and good judgment | [Epistemics](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/epistemics/) |
| **Adaptability** | Ability to adjust to rapid change | [Adaptability](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/adaptability/) |

## Relationship to Scenarios

Civilizational Competence acts as a **protective factor** - higher competence decreases risk across multiple scenarios:

- **AI Takeover**: Better governance and oversight reduces probability
- **Human-Caused Catastrophe**: Better coordination prevents misuse escalation
- **Long-term Lock-in**: Shapes whether lock-in is beneficial or harmful

## Component Parameters

This factor aggregates many underlying parameters including:
- International coordination
- Institutional quality
- Regulatory capacity
- Societal trust
- Epistemic health
- Human agency and expertise

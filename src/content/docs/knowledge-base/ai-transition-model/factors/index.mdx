## Overview

Aggregate Parameters bridge the gap between individual [leaf parameters](/knowledge-base/parameters/) and [outcome parameters](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/). They group related factors that work together to influence the same outcomes.

| Aggregate | Primary Outcome | Components |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| [**Technical Safety**](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/technical-safety/) | Acute Risk ↓ | Alignment Robustness, Safety-Capability Gap, Interpretability, Oversight, Safety Culture |
| [**Governance Capacity**](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/governance-capacity/) | All three | Regulatory Capacity, Institutional Quality, International & Domestic Coordination, Racing (inverse) |
| [**Epistemic Foundation**](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/epistemic-foundation/) | Steady State + Transition | Epistemic Health, Information Authenticity, Reality Coherence, Trust, Preference Authenticity |
| [**Societal Adaptability**](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/societal-adaptability/) | Transition ↓ | Societal Resilience, Economic Stability, Human Expertise, Human Agency |
| [**Threat Environment**](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/threat-environment/) | Acute Risk ↑ | Bio/Cyber Threat Exposure, AI Control Concentration, Racing Intensity |

## How Aggregates Work

Each aggregate groups parameters that:
1. **Influence the same outcomes** through similar mechanisms
2. **Interact with each other** (changes in one affect others in the group)
3. **Respond to similar interventions** (policies that improve one often improve others)

This grouping helps identify:
- **Leverage points**: Which clusters of parameters are most important
- **Intervention targets**: Where policy or research can have broad impact
- **Correlations**: Which improvements tend to come together

---

## Cross-Aggregate Interactions

Some parameters appear in multiple aggregates because they affect multiple outcome pathways:

| Parameter | Aggregates | Why Multiple |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Racing Intensity | Governance, Threat Environment | Undermines governance AND increases threat exposure |
| Human Oversight Quality | Technical Safety, Societal Adaptability | Both technical capability AND human capacity matter |
| AI Control Concentration | Threat Environment, affects Steady State | Both acute risk AND long-term power distribution |

## Overview

Root Factors are the top-level causal drivers that shape AI transition outcomes. They bridge the gap between specific [component parameters](#) and [ultimate outcomes](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/outcomes/) like existential catastrophe and long-term trajectory.

See the [interactive AI transition model](/ai-transition-model/) for a visual representation.

| Factor | Description | Primary Outcomes |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| [**Misalignment Potential**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/) | Likelihood AI pursues unintended goals | AI Takeover ↑, Existential Catastrophe ↑ |
| [**AI Capabilities**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/ai-capabilities/) | How powerful AI systems become | Enables all scenarios |
| [**Civilizational Competence**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/) | Humanity's ability to respond well | AI Takeover ↓, Human Catastrophe ↓ |
| [**Transition Turbulence**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/) | Background instability during transition | AI Takeover ↑, Human Catastrophe ↑ |
| [**Misuse Potential**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/) | Potential for AI to be weaponized | Human Catastrophe ↑ |

## Factor Components

Each root factor contains multiple component parameters:

### Misalignment Potential
- [Alignment Robustness](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/alignment-robustness/)
- [Safety-Capability Gap](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/safety-capability-gap/)
- [Interpretability Coverage](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/interpretability-coverage/)
- [Human Oversight Quality](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/human-oversight-quality/)
- [Safety Culture Strength](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/safety-culture-strength/)

### Civilizational Competence
- [Governance](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/governance/)
- [Epistemics](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/epistemics/)
- [Adaptability](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/adaptability/)

### Transition Turbulence
- [Economic Stability](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/economic-stability/)
- [Racing Intensity](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/racing-intensity/)

### Misuse Potential
- [Biological Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/biological-threat-exposure/)
- [Cyber Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/cyber-threat-exposure/)
- [AI Control Concentration](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/ai-control-concentration/)

## Cross-Factor Interactions

Some parameters interact across multiple factors:

| Parameter | Factors | Interaction |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Racing Intensity | Transition Turbulence, affects Misalignment Potential | Racing undermines safety AND causes turbulence |
| AI Control Concentration | Misuse Potential, affects Long-term Trajectory | Concentration enables both misuse AND lock-in |
| Human Oversight Quality | Misalignment Potential, requires Civilizational Competence | Technical oversight needs societal capacity |

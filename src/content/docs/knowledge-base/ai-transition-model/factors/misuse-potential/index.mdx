## Overview

Threat Environment measures the external factors that could cause or amplify catastrophic AI-related events. Unlike [Technical Safety](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/) (which measures our defenses), Threat Environment measures the attacks, misuses, and dangerous dynamics we face.

**Primary outcome affected:** [Acute Risk](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/outcomes/existential-catastrophe/) ↑↑↑

High threat environment means more vectors for catastrophe even if technical safety is strong. These threats can overwhelm defenses, trigger cascading failures, or exploit concentrated power.

| Parameter | Role | Current State |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| [Biological Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/biological-threat-exposure/) | AI-enabled bioweapon risk | Contested (defense may win) |
| [Cyber Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/cyber-threat-exposure/) | AI-enabled cyber attack risk | High (60% face AI attacks) |
| [AI Control Concentration](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/ai-control-concentration/) | Single point of failure / capture risk | Increasing concentration |
| [Racing Intensity](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/racing-intensity/) | Pressure that undermines safety | High (80-85 composite score) |

## Internal Dynamics

These threats compound each other:

- **Racing accelerates all threats**: Competitive pressure leads to faster deployment of offensive capabilities
- **Concentration amplifies impact**: When control is concentrated, single failures affect everyone
- **Bio and cyber interact**: Same AI capabilities that enable one often enable the other
- **Threat success breeds threat**: Successful attacks demonstrate viability and attract more actors

This creates **threat escalation dynamics**—each incident makes the next more likely.

## How This Affects Outcomes

| Outcome | Effect | Mechanism |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| [Acute Risk](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/outcomes/existential-catastrophe/) | ↑↑↑ Primary | Direct increase in catastrophic event probability |
| [Transition](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/) | ↑ Secondary | Major incidents cause disruption during transition |
| [Steady State](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/outcomes/long-term-trajectory/) | ↑ Secondary | Concentrated power shapes long-term distribution |

## Relationship to Technical Safety

Threat Environment and [Technical Safety](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/) work in opposition:

| Factor | Technical Safety | Threat Environment |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Direction | Reduces acute risk | Increases acute risk |
| Focus | Our defenses | Their attacks |
| Improvability | Research & investment | Harder to reduce |
| Dynamics | Cumulative progress | Escalation spirals |

**The balance matters**: High technical safety can offset high threat environment, but overwhelming threats can defeat any defense. Racing intensity affects both—it degrades safety while accelerating threats.

---

## Why Concentration Matters

AI Control Concentration is unique because its effect **depends on who controls**:
- If control concentrates in **safety-conscious actors**: May reduce risk
- If control concentrates in **reckless or malicious actors**: Dramatically increases risk
- In either case: **Reduces resilience** to bad actors gaining control

This makes concentration a key uncertainty in acute risk assessment.

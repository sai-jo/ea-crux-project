## Overview

Acute Risk measures the probability and potential severity of catastrophic AI-related events. This is about the **tail risks**—the scenarios we most urgently want to avoid because they could cause irreversible harm at civilizational scale.

Unlike [Transition Smoothness](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/) (which concerns the journey) or [Steady State Quality](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/outcomes/long-term-trajectory/) (which concerns the destination), Acute Risk is about avoiding catastrophe entirely. A world with high acute risk might navigate a smooth transition to a good steady state—or might not make it there at all.

## Sub-dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Key Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Loss of Control** | AI systems pursuing goals misaligned with humanity; inability to correct or shut down advanced systems | Alignment Robustness, Human Oversight Quality |
| **Misuse Catastrophe** | Deliberate weaponization of AI for mass harm—bioweapons, autonomous weapons, critical infrastructure attacks | Biological Threat Exposure, Cyber Threat Exposure |
| **Accident at Scale** | Unintended large-scale harms from deployed systems; cascading failures across interconnected AI | Safety-Capability Gap, Safety Culture Strength |
| **Lock-in Risk** | Irreversible commitment to bad values, goals, or power structures | AI Control Concentration, Institutional Quality |
| **Concentration Catastrophe** | Single actor gains decisive AI advantage and uses it harmfully | AI Control Concentration, Racing Intensity |

### Primary Contributing Aggregates

| Aggregate | Relationship | Mechanism |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| [Technical Safety Capacity](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/) | ↓↓↓ Decreases risk | Aligned, interpretable, overseen systems are less likely to cause catastrophe |
| [Threat Environment](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/) | ↑↑↑ Increases risk | Higher bio/cyber exposure, concentration, and racing all elevate acute risk |
| [Governance Capacity](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/governance/) | ↓↓ Decreases risk | Effective governance can slow racing, enforce safety standards, coordinate responses |

### Key Individual Parameters

| Parameter | Effect | Strength |

| [Racing Intensity](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/racing-intensity/) | ↑ Increases | ↑↑↑ Strong |
| [Human Oversight Quality](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/human-oversight-quality/) | ↓ Reduces | ↓↓ Strong |
| [Interpretability Coverage](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/interpretability-coverage/) | ↓ Reduces | ↓↓ Strong |
| [AI Control Concentration](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/ai-control-concentration/) | ↑/↓ Depends | ↑↑ Context-dependent |
| [Biological Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/biological-threat-exposure/) | ↑ Increases | ↑↑ Direct |
| [Cyber Threat Exposure](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misuse-potential/cyber-threat-exposure/) | ↑ Increases | ↑↑ Direct |

## Why This Matters

Acute risk is the most time-sensitive outcome dimension:
- **Irreversibility**: Many catastrophic scenarios cannot be undone
- **Path dependence**: High acute risk can foreclose good steady states entirely
- **Limited recovery**: Unlike transition disruption, catastrophe may preclude recovery
- **Urgency**: Near-term capability advances increase near-term acute risk

This is why much AI safety work focuses on acute risk reduction—it's the outcome where failure is most permanent.

## Overview

Parameters are the measurable components that determine root factors like [Misalignment Potential](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/) and [Civilizational Competence](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/). Each parameter has:

- **Current state** with quantified metrics
- **Trajectory** showing improvement or decline
- **Factors that increase/decrease** the parameter
- **Connection to outcomes** through parent factors

See the [interactive AI transition model](/ai-transition-model/) for a visual representation.

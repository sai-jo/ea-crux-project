## Overview

Long-term Lock-in refers to scenarios where AI enables the permanent entrenchment of certain conditions - whether values, power structures, or epistemic environments. Unlike acute catastrophes, lock-in may unfold gradually and may not be immediately recognized as harmful.

## Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Values**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/long-term-lockin/values/) | Permanent entrenchment of particular value systems |
| [**Power**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/long-term-lockin/power/) | Concentration of power that becomes impossible to reverse |
| [**Epistemics**](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/long-term-lockin/epistemics/) | Permanent degradation or ossification of collective reasoning |

## Key Root Factors

Long-term Lock-in is primarily shaped by:

| Factor | Relationship | Mechanism |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| [Civilizational Competence](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/civilizational-competence/) | Shapes character | Determines whether lock-in is beneficial or harmful |

## Dual Nature

Unlike other scenarios, lock-in is not inherently negative:

| Pole | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Positive** | Beneficial values and institutions stabilized, protected from degradation |
| **Negative** | Authoritarian control, harmful ideologies, or stagnation permanently entrenched |

## Outcomes

Long-term Lock-in primarily affects:
- **Long-term Trajectory**: The quality and character of the post-transition future
- May contribute to **Existential Catastrophe** if lock-in prevents course correction

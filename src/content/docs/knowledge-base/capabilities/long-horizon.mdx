## Overview

Long-horizon autonomy refers to AI systems' ability to work toward goals over extended time periods—hours, days, or even weeks—with minimal human intervention. This capability requires maintaining context, adapting to obstacles, managing subgoals, and staying aligned with objectives despite changing circumstances.

This is one of the most safety-critical capabilities because it determines whether AI remains a tool requiring constant supervision or becomes an autonomous agent pursuing goals independently.

## What Long-Horizon Tasks Require

### Memory and Context
Maintaining state over time:
- What has been done
- What remains to be done
- Important facts and constraints
- Previous failures and learnings

### Goal Decomposition
Breaking large goals into manageable pieces:
- Identifying subgoals
- Ordering dependencies
- Allocating resources
- Adjusting priorities

### Error Recovery
Handling failures gracefully:
- Detecting when stuck
- Trying alternative approaches
- Asking for help when needed
- Learning from mistakes

### World Modeling
Understanding the environment:
- Tracking state changes
- Predicting outcomes
- Modeling other agents
- Anticipating obstacles

### Sustained Alignment
Maintaining goal fidelity:
- Avoiding goal drift
- Resisting distractions
- Staying within bounds
- Checking in with objectives

## Current State

### What Works (Minutes to Hours)
Current systems can handle:
- Simple coding tasks (e.g., implementing a feature)
- Data analysis workflows
- Research and summarization
- Content creation
- Customer service interactions

### What Doesn't Work (Days to Weeks)
Current limitations:
- Multi-day projects
- Complex dependencies
- Novel environments
- High-stakes decisions
- Truly autonomous research

### Scaffolding Requirements
Existing "long-horizon" systems need:
- Explicit planning frameworks
- External memory systems
- Frequent checkpoints
- Human oversight
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Examples of Current Systems

### Coding Agents
- **Devin**: Claims to work on tasks for hours
- **SWE-bench**: Benchmark for repository-level coding
- **AutoGPT/BabyAGI**: Early autonomous agent experiments

### Research Agents
- **Deep Research**: Multi-hour research tasks
- **Scholar AI**: Literature review assistance
- **Research assistants**: Query-guided investigation

### Business Automation
- **Customer service bots**: Handle full interactions
- **Data analysis agents**: Complete analytical workflows
- **Content generation**: Multi-step content creation

## Key Challenges

### Context Management
Current models:
- Have limited context windows
- Forget earlier work
- Don't maintain consistent state
- Struggle with complex project structure

### Planning Limitations
Difficulty with:
- Truly novel situations
- Complex dependencies
- Unknown unknowns
- Adaptive replanning

### Alignment Drift
Over long horizons:
- Goals can shift subtly
- Shortcuts get taken
- Constraints get forgotten
- Original intent lost

### Evaluation Difficulty
Hard to assess:
- Success may take days to determine
- Many possible solution paths
- Quality vs speed tradeoffs
- Partial credit unclear

## Safety Implications

### Why This Is Critical
Long-horizon autonomy is the difference between:
- Tools (require constant supervision)
- Agents (operate independently)

### Power-Seeking Enabled
With long-horizon capability, AI can:
- Accumulate resources
- Build infrastructure
- Establish dependencies
- Resist shutdown

### Reduced Oversight
Humans cannot:
- Monitor every decision
- Approve every action
- Predict all consequences
- Stay continuously engaged

### Compounding Errors
Small misalignments:
- Accumulate over time
- Create path dependencies
- Become harder to reverse
- May go unnoticed until major

## Trajectory

### Current (2024-2025)
- Minutes: Reliable
- Hours: Works with scaffolding
- Days: Experimental
- Weeks: Not feasible

### Near-term (1-2 years)
- Hours: Highly reliable
- Days: Works for well-defined tasks
- Weeks: Experimental
- Months: Not feasible

### Medium-term (2-5 years)
- Days: Reliable
- Weeks: Works well
- Months: Possible for some tasks
- Continuous: For specific domains

### Implications
Rapid progress means:
- Less time than expected to autonomous AI
- Safety work must happen sooner
- Economic disruption accelerates
- Control becomes harder

## What Would Enable Longer Horizons

### Technical Advances
- Better memory architectures
- Improved planning algorithms
- More robust error recovery
- Enhanced world models
- Better self-monitoring

### Scaffolding Improvements
- External memory systems
- Hierarchical task management
- Checkpoint mechanisms
- Human-in-the-loop protocols
- Tool ecosystems

### Training Improvements
- RL on long-horizon tasks
- Better exploration strategies
- Transfer learning
- Meta-learning for adaptation

## Safety Approaches

### Limitation
Simply don't build long-horizon systems:
- Keep humans in the loop
- Require frequent approval
- Limit task duration
- Maintain oversight

### Monitoring
Watch what long-horizon agents do:
- Comprehensive logging
- Anomaly detection
- Checkpoint reviews
- Automated red flags

### Containment
Restrict what agents can access:
- Sandboxed environments
- Limited permissions
- Resource quotas
- Reversibility requirements

### Alignment
Ensure goals stay stable:
- Regular objective checking
- Constraint enforcement
- Value learning
- Corrigibility

### AI Control
Design systems safe even with misaligned long-horizon agents:
- Trusted monitors
- Capability limitations
- Protocol design
- Red team testing

## Research Directions

### Capabilities Research

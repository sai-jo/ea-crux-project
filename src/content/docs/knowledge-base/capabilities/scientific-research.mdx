## Overview

Scientific research capabilities refer to AI systems' ability to conduct scientific investigations, generate hypotheses, design experiments, analyze results, and make discoveries. This ranges from narrow tools that assist with specific tasks to systems approaching autonomous scientific reasoning.

This capability is critical for AI safety because it determines AI's ability to accelerate technological development (including more capable AI), solve challenging problems (including alignment), and potentially create dangerous technologies.

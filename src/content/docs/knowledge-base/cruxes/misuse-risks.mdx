## Overview

Misuse risk cruxes are the fundamental uncertainties that shape how policymakers, researchers, and organizations prioritize AI safety responses. These 13 cruxes determine whether AI provides meaningful "uplift" to malicious actors (30-45% say significant vs 35-45% modest), whether AI will favor offensive or defensive capabilities across security domains, and how effective various mitigation strategies can be.

Current evidence remains mixed across domains. The <R id="0fe4cfa7ca5f2270">RAND biological uplift study</R> (January 2024) tested 15 red teams with and without LLM access, finding no statistically significant difference in bioweapon attack plan viability. However, RAND's subsequent [Global Risk Index for AI-enabled Biological Tools](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/2024/ai-risk-index.html) (2024) evaluated 57 state-of-the-art tools and indexed 13 as "Red" (action required), with one tool reaching the highest level of critical misuse-relevant capabilities. Meanwhile, <R id="2b6675e423040e53">CNAS analyses</R> and [Georgetown CSET research](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/how-to-assess-the-likelihood-of-malicious-use-of-advanced-ai-systems/) emphasize that rapid capability improvements require ongoing reassessment.

In cybersecurity, [OpenAI's threat assessment](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-cyber-resilience/) (December 2025) notes that AI cyber capabilities improved from 27% to 76% on capture-the-flag benchmarks between August and November 2025, with 50% of critical infrastructure organizations reporting AI-powered attacks in the past year. Deepfake incidents grew from 500,000 files in 2023 to a projected 8 million by 2025, with businesses losing an average of \$100,000 per deepfake-related fraud incident.

The stakes are substantial: if AI provides significant capability uplift to malicious actors, urgent restrictions on model access and [compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) become critical. If defenses can keep pace with offensive capabilities, investment priorities shift toward detection and response systems rather than prevention.

## Offense vs Defense Balance

### Cyber Domain Assessment

| Capability | Offensive Potential | Defensive Potential | Current Balance | Trend | Evidence |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| **Vulnerability Discovery** | High - CTF scores 27%->76% (3 months) | Medium - AI-assisted patching | Favors offense | Accelerating | [OpenAI 2025](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-cyber-resilience/) |
| **Social Engineering** | Very High - voice phishing up 442% | Low - human factor remains | Strongly favors offense | Widening gap | 49% of businesses report deepfake fraud |
| **Incident Response** | Low | High - automated threat hunting | Favors defense | Strengthening | \$1B+ annual AI cybersecurity investment |
| **Malware Development** | Medium - autonomous malware adapting in real-time | High - behavioral detection | Roughly balanced | Evolving | [Microsoft 2025 DDR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025) |
| **Attribution** | Medium - obfuscation tools | High - pattern analysis | Favors defense | Improving | State actors experimenting (CN, RU, IR, NK) |

The cyber landscape is evolving rapidly. According to [Microsoft's 2025 Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025), adversaries are increasingly using generative AI for scaling social engineering, automating lateral movement, discovering vulnerabilities, and evading security controls. Chinese, Russian, Iranian, and North Korean cyber actors are already integrating AI to enhance their operations.

### Deepfake and Disinformation Metrics (2024-2025)

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Deepfake video growth** | 550% increase (2019-2024); 95,820 videos (2023) | Accelerating | [Deepstrike 2025](https://deepstrike.io/blog/deepfake-statistics-2025) |
| **Projected synthetic content** | 90% of online content by 2026 | Europol estimate | [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2025/775855/EPRS_BRI(2025)775855_EN.pdf) |
| **Human detection accuracy (video)** | 24.5% | Asymmetrically low | Academic studies |
| **Human detection accuracy (images)** | 62% | Moderate | Academic studies |
| **Tool detection accuracy** | ~75% | Arms race dynamic | [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/deepfakes-and-crisis-knowing) |
| **Confident in detection ability** | Only 9% of adults | Public awareness gap | Surveys |
| **Political deepfakes documented** | 82 cases across 38 countries (mid-2023 to mid-2024) | Increasing | Academic research |
| **North America fraud increase** | 1,740% | Dramatic acceleration | Industry reports |
| **Voice phishing increase** | 442% (late 2024) | Driven by voice cloning | [ZeroThreat](https://zerothreat.ai/blog/deepfake-and-ai-phishing-statistics) |

The detection gap is widening: while deepfake generation has become dramatically easier, human ability to detect synthetic content remains critically low. Only 0.1% of participants across modalities could reliably spot fakes in mixed tests, according to [UNESCO research](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/deepfakes-and-crisis-knowing). This asymmetry strongly supports investing in provenance-based authentication systems like [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) rather than relying on detection alone.

## Mitigation Effectiveness 

### Model Restriction Approaches

| Restriction Type | Implementation Difficulty | Circumvention Difficulty | Effectiveness Assessment | Current Deployment |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Training-time Safety** | Medium | High | Moderate - affects base capabilities | <R id="e99a5c1697baa07d">Constitutional AI</R> |
| **Output Filtering** | Low | Low | Low - easily bypassed | Most commercial APIs |
| **Fine-tuning Prevention** | High | Medium | High - but open models complicate | Limited implementation |
| **Access Controls** | Medium | Medium | Moderate - depends on enforcement | <R id="e64764924758e86b">OpenAI</R> terms |
| **Weight Security** | High | High | Very High - if enforceable | Early development |

### International Autonomous Weapons Governance Status (2024-2025)

| Development | Status | Key Actors | Implications |
|-------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **UN General Assembly Resolution** | Passed Dec 2024 (166-3; Russia, North Korea, Belarus opposed) | UN member states | Strong international momentum; not legally binding |
| **CCW Group of Governmental Experts** | 10 days of sessions (Mar 3-7, Sep 1-5, 2025) | High Contracting Parties | Rolling text from Nov 2024 outlines regulatory measures |
| **Treaty Goal** | Target completion by end of 2026 | UN Sec-Gen Guterres, ICRC President Spoljaric | Ambitious timeline; window narrowing |
| **US Position** | Governance framework via DoD 2020 Ethical Principles; no ban | US DoD | Responsible, traceable, governable AI within human command |
| **China Position** | Ban on "unacceptable" LAWS (lethal, autonomous, unterminating, indiscriminate, self-learning) | China delegation | Partial ban approach; "acceptable" LAWS permitted |
| **Existing Systems** | Phalanx CIWS (1970s), Iron Dome, Trophy, sentry guns (S. Korea, Israel) | Various militaries | Precedent of autonomous targeting for decades |

According to [Congressional Research Service analysis](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11150), the U.S. does not prohibit LAWS development or employment, and some senior defense leaders have stated the U.S. may be compelled to develop such systems. The [ASIL Insights](https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/29/issue/1) notes growing momentum toward a new international treaty, though concerns remain about the rapidly narrowing window for effective regulation.

- **Defensive Maturity**: AI-powered detection and response systems become standard across critical infrastructure  
- **Governance Infrastructure**: [Compute monitoring](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/monitoring/) systems deployed, international agreements on [autonomous weapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/autonomous-weapons/) 
- **Attack Sophistication**: First sophisticated AI-enabled attacks likely demonstrated, shifting threat perceptions significantly

### Long-term Uncertainty (2030+)

Key trajectories that remain highly uncertain:

| Trend | Optimistic Scenario | Pessimistic Scenario | Key Determinants |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Capability Diffusion** | Controlled through governance | Widespread proliferation | International cooperation success |
| **Offense-Defense Balance** | Defense keeps pace | Offense advantage widens | R&D investment allocation |
| **Authentication Adoption** | Universal verification | Fragmented ecosystem | Platform cooperation |
| **International Cooperation** | Effective regimes emerge | Fragmentation and competition | Geopolitical stability |

## Key Uncertainties & Expert Disagreements

### Technical Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Range of Views | Current Evidence | Resolution Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **LLM biological uplift** | No uplift (RAND 2024) vs. concerning (CSET, Esvelt) | Mixed; wet-lab bottleneck may dominate | 2-5 years as capabilities improve |
| **AI cyber capability ceiling** | Commodity attacks only vs. sophisticated intrusions | CTF benchmarks improving rapidly (27%->76%) | 1-3 years; being resolved now |
| **Deepfake detection viability** | Arms race favoring offense vs. provenance solutions | Human detection at 24.5%; tools at 75% | 2-4 years; depends on C2PA adoption |
| **Open model misuse potential** | Democratization benefits vs. misuse risks | DeepSeek-R1 cost breakthrough; no catastrophic misuse yet | Ongoing; each release re-evaluated |

### Policy Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Range of Views | Current Evidence | Resolution Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Compute governance effectiveness** | Strong chokepoint vs. easily circumvented | Export controls having effect; evasion ongoing | 3-5 years as enforcement matures |
| **LAWS treaty feasibility** | Treaty achievable by 2026 vs. inevitable proliferation | UN resolution 166-3; CCW negotiations ongoing | 2026 target deadline |
| **Model restriction value** | Meaningful reduction vs. security theater | Jailbreaks common; open models exist | Ongoing empirical question |
| **Authentication adoption** | Universal adoption vs. fragmented ecosystem | C2PA growing; major platforms uncommitted | 3-5 years for critical mass |

### Expert Disagreement Summary

The AI safety and security community remains divided on several fundamental questions. According to [Georgetown CSET's assessment framework](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/how-to-assess-the-likelihood-of-malicious-use-of-advanced-ai-systems/), these disagreements stem from genuine uncertainty about rapidly evolving capabilities, differing risk tolerances, and varying assumptions about attacker sophistication and motivation.

Key areas of active debate include:

1. **Bioweapons uplift magnitude**: RAND's 2024 red-team study found no significant uplift, but their Global Risk Index identified 13 high-risk biological AI tools. OpenAI's o3 model scoring at the 94th percentile among virologists suggests capabilities are advancing.

2. **Offense-defense balance**: [OpenAI's threat assessment](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-cyber-resilience/) acknowledges planning for models reaching "High" cyber capability levels that could develop zero-day exploits or assist with complex intrusions. Meanwhile, defensive AI investment is growing rapidly.

3. **Regulatory approach**: The U.S. DoD favors governance frameworks over bans for LAWS, while 166 UN member states voted for a resolution calling for action. China distinguishes "acceptable" from "unacceptable" autonomous weapons.

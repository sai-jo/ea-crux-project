## Overview

Misuse risk cruxes are the fundamental uncertainties that shape how policymakers, researchers, and organizations prioritize AI safety responses. These 13 cruxes determine whether AI provides meaningful "uplift" to malicious actors (30-45% say significant vs 35-45% modest), whether AI will favor offensive or defensive capabilities across security domains, and how effective various mitigation strategies can be.

Current evidence remains mixed across domains. The [RAND biological uplift study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-2.html) found no significant capability increase for bioweapons development, while [CNAS analyses](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/ai-and-the-evolution-of-biological-national-security-risks) suggest more concerning possibilities. Similarly, while AI-powered cyberattacks remain largely commodity-level, the potential for scaling and sophistication growth creates significant uncertainty about future threat landscapes.

The stakes are substantial: if AI provides significant capability uplift to malicious actors, urgent restrictions on model access and [compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) become critical. If defenses can keep pace with offensive capabilities, investment priorities shift toward detection and response systems rather than prevention.

## Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk Category | Severity Assessment | Timeline | Current Trend | Key Uncertainty |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bioweapons Uplift** | High (if real) | 2-5 years | Mixed evidence | Wet-lab bottlenecks vs information barriers |
| **Cyber Capability Enhancement** | Medium-High | 1-3 years | Gradual increase | Commodity vs sophisticated attack gap |
| **Autonomous Weapons** | High | Ongoing | Accelerating | International cooperation effectiveness |
| **Mass Disinformation** | Medium-High | Current | Detection losing | Authentication adoption rates |
| **Surveillance Authoritarianism** | Medium | Ongoing | Expanding deployment | Democratic resilience factors |
| **Chemical Weapons** | Medium | 3-7 years | Early evidence | Synthesis barrier strength |
| **Infrastructure Disruption** | High | 1-4 years | Escalating complexity | Critical system vulnerabilities |

## Mitigation Effectiveness 

### Model Restriction Approaches

| Restriction Type | Implementation Difficulty | Circumvention Difficulty | Effectiveness Assessment | Current Deployment |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Training-time Safety** | Medium | High | Moderate - affects base capabilities | [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) |
| **Output Filtering** | Low | Low | Low - easily bypassed | Most commercial APIs |
| **Fine-tuning Prevention** | High | Medium | High - but open models complicate | Limited implementation |
| **Access Controls** | Medium | Medium | Moderate - depends on enforcement | [OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) terms |
| **Weight Security** | High | High | Very High - if enforceable | Early development |

## Current State & Trajectory

### Near-term Developments (2024-2026)

| Development Area | Current Status | Expected Trajectory | Key Factors |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Model Capabilities** | GPT-4 level reasoning, coding | Human-level in specialized domains | Scaling laws, compute access |
| **Defense Investment** | $2B+ annual cybersecurity AI | 3-5x growth expected | Threat awareness, budget cycles |
| **Regulatory Response** | [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), US executive orders | Federal legislation likely | Political pressure, incident triggers |
| **Open Source Models** | Llama 2, Mistral release patterns | Continued but controlled growth | Meta strategy, safety concerns |
| **Compute Governance** | Initial export controls | Monitoring systems deployment | International coordination |

### Medium-term Projections (2026-2030)

- **Capability Thresholds**: Models approaching human performance in specialized domains like biochemistry and cybersecurity
- **Defensive Maturity**: AI-powered detection and response systems become standard across critical infrastructure  
- **Governance Infrastructure**: [Compute monitoring](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/monitoring/) systems deployed, international agreements on [autonomous weapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/autonomous-weapons/) 
- **Attack Sophistication**: First sophisticated AI-enabled attacks likely demonstrated, shifting threat perceptions significantly

### Long-term Uncertainty (2030+)

Key trajectories that remain highly uncertain:

| Trend | Optimistic Scenario | Pessimistic Scenario | Key Determinants |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Capability Diffusion** | Controlled through governance | Widespread proliferation | International cooperation success |
| **Offense-Defense Balance** | Defense keeps pace | Offense advantage widens | R&D investment allocation |
| **Authentication Adoption** | Universal verification | Fragmented ecosystem | Platform cooperation |
| **International Cooperation** | Effective regimes emerge | Fragmentation and competition | Geopolitical stability |

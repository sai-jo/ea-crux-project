<PageStatus quality={4} lastEdited="2025-12-24" llmSummary="Comprehensive coverage of 10 solution-focused cruxes examining technical approaches (AI verification scaling, provenance vs detection, watermark robustness), collective intelligence mechanisms (forecasting, prediction markets, deliberation), coordination feasibility (lab and international coordination, commitment credibility), and infrastructure challenges (epistemic public goods, platform incentives)." />

## What Are Solution Cruxes?

Different views on **key uncertainties** lead to different solution priorities. Your answers to these cruxes should inform what you work on, fund, or advocate for.

These cruxes focus on **solution tractability and effectiveness**—not the underlying problems (covered in [Epistemic Cruxes](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/cruxes/)).

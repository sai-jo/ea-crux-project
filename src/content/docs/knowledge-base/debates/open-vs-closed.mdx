One of the most heated debates in AI: Should powerful AI models be released as open source (weights publicly available), or kept closed to prevent misuse?

## What's At Stake

**Open source** means releasing model weights so anyone can download, modify, and run the model locally:
- Examples: Llama 2, Mistral, Falcon
- Can't be recalled or controlled after release
- Anyone can fine-tune for any purpose

**Closed source** means keeping weights proprietary, providing access only via API:
- Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- Lab maintains control and can monitor usage
- Can update, revoke access, refuse harmful requests

## Possible Middle Grounds

Several proposals try to capture benefits of both:

**Staged Release**
- Release with 6-12 month delay after initial deployment
- Allows monitoring for risks before open release
- Example: Not done yet, but proposed

**Structured Access**
- Provide weights to vetted researchers
- More access than API, less than fully public
- Example: GPT-2 XL initially

**Differential Access**
- Smaller models open, frontier models closed
- Balance innovation with safety
- Example: Current status quo

**Safety-Contingent Release**
- Release if safety evaluations pass thresholds
- Create clear criteria for release decisions
- Example: Anthropic's RSP (for deployment, not release)

**Open Source with Hardware Controls**
- Release weights but require specialized hardware to run
- Harder but not perfect control
- Example: Not implemented

## The International Dimension

This debate has geopolitical implications:

**If US/Western labs stay closed:**
- May slow dangerous capabilities
- But China may open source strategically
- Could lose innovation race

**If US/Western labs open source:**
- Loses monitoring capability
- But levels playing field globally
- Benefits developing world

**Coordination problem:**
- Optimal if all major powers coordinate
- But unilateral restraint may not work
- Race dynamics push toward openness

## Implications for Different Risks

The open vs closed question has different implications for different risks:

**Misuse risks (bioweapons, cyberattacks):**
- Clear case for closed: irreversibility, removal of guardrails
- Open source dramatically increases risk

**Accident risks (unintended behavior):**
- Mixed: Open source enables safety research but also deployment
- Depends on whether scrutiny or proliferation dominates

**Structural risks (power concentration):**
- Clear case for open: prevents monopoly
- But only if open source is actually accessible (requires compute)

**Race dynamics:**
- Open source may accelerate race (lower barriers)
- But also may reduce pressure (can build on shared base)

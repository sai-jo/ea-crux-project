llmSummary: "Comprehensive debate analysis examining whether scaling compute/data alone can achieve AGI versus requiring new paradigms. Presents 6 pro-scaling arguments (scaling laws, emergent abilities, empirical success) and counterarguments (understanding gaps, data limits, reasoning failures) with evidence from both sides, concluding expert disagreement remains strong."

One of the most consequential debates in AI: Can we achieve AGI simply by making current approaches (transformers, neural networks) bigger, or do we need fundamental breakthroughs in architecture and methodology?

## The Question

**Scaling hypothesis**: Current deep learning approaches will reach human-level and superhuman intelligence through:
- More compute (bigger models, longer training)
- More data (larger, higher-quality datasets)
- Better engineering (efficiency improvements)

**New paradigms hypothesis**: We need fundamentally different approaches because current methods hit fundamental limits.

## What Would Change Minds?

**For scaling optimists to update toward skepticism:**
- Scaling 100x with only marginal capability improvements
- Hitting hard data or compute walls
- Proof that key capabilities (planning, causality) can't emerge from current architectures
- Persistent failures on simple reasoning despite increasing scale

**For skeptics to update toward scaling:**
- GPT-5/6 showing qualitatively new reasoning capabilities
- Solving ARC or other generalization benchmarks via pure scaling
- Continued emergent abilities at each scale-up
- Clear path around data limitations

## Implications for AI Safety

This debate has major implications:

**If scaling works:**
- Short timelines (AGI within 5-10 years)
- Predictable capability trajectory
- Safety research can focus on aligning scaled-up LLMs
- Winner-take-all dynamics (whoever scales most wins)

**If new paradigms needed:**
- Longer timelines (10-30+ years)
- More uncertainty about capability trajectory
- Safety research needs to consider unknown architectures
- More opportunity for safety-by-default designs

**Hybrid scenario:**
- Medium timelines (5-15 years)
- Some predictability, some surprises
- Safety research should cover both scaled LLMs and new architectures

## Historical Parallels

**Cases where scaling worked:**
- ImageNet → Deep learning revolution (2012)
- GPT-2 → GPT-3 → GPT-4 trajectory
- AlphaGo scaling to AlphaZero
- Transformer scaling unlocking new capabilities

**Cases where new paradigms were needed:**
- Perceptrons → Neural networks (needed backprop + hidden layers)
- RNNs → Transformers (needed attention mechanism)
- Expert systems → Statistical learning (needed paradigm shift)

The question: Which pattern are we in now?

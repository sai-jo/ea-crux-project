## Overview

AGI development represents the global race to build artificial general intelligence - systems matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive domains. Current trajectories suggest median AGI arrival between 2028-2032, with development concentrated among 3-4 major labs investing $10-100B+ annually. This concentration creates significant coordination challenges and [racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/) that could compromise safety research.

The field has shifted from academic research to industrial competition, with [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/), [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/), [DeepMind](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/deepmind/), and emerging players like [xAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/xai/) pursuing different technical approaches while facing similar resource constraints and timeline pressures.

### Resource Requirements Trajectory

Current AGI development demands exponentially increasing resources:

| Resource Type | 2024 Scale | 2026 Projection | 2028+ Requirements |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Training Compute** | 10^25 FLOPs | 10^26-10^27 FLOPs | 10^28+ FLOPs |
| **Training Cost** | $100M-1B | $1-10B | $10-100B |
| **Electricity** | 50-100 MW | 500-1000 MW | 1-10 GW |
| **Skilled Researchers** | 1000-3000 | 5000-10000 | 10000+ |
| **H100 Equivalent GPUs** | 100K+ | 1M+ | 10M+ |

## Key Capability Thresholds

AGI development targets specific capability milestones that indicate progress toward human-level performance:

### Current Capability Gaps
- **Long-horizon planning**: Limited to hours/days vs. human years/decades
- **[Scientific research](/knowledge-base/capabilities/scientific-research/)**: Narrow domain assistance vs. autonomous discovery
- **Real-world [agentic behavior](/knowledge-base/capabilities/agentic-ai/)**: Supervised task execution vs. autonomous goal pursuit
- **[Self-improvement](/knowledge-base/capabilities/self-improvement/)**: Assisted optimization vs. recursive enhancement

### 2025-2027 Expected Milestones
- PhD-level performance in most academic domains
- Autonomous software engineering at human expert level
- Multi-modal reasoning approaching human performance
- Planning horizons extending to weeks/months

## Geopolitical Development Landscape

AGI development increasingly shaped by international competition and regulatory responses:

### US-China Competition
| Factor | US Position | China Position | Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Leading Labs** | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind | Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance | Technology fragmentation |
| **Compute Access** | H100 restrictions on China | Domestic chip development | Capability gaps emerging |
| **Talent Pool** | Immigration restrictions growing | Domestic talent retention | Brain drain dynamics |
| **Investment** | Private + government funding | State-directed investment | Different risk tolerances |

## Safety Research Integration

Critical gap exists between AGI development timelines and safety research readiness:

### Current Safety-Capability Gap
| Domain | Development State | Safety Research State | Gap Assessment |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **[Alignment](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/)** | Production systems | Early research | 3-5 year lag |
| **[Interpretability](/knowledge-base/debates/interpretability-sufficient/)** | Limited deployment | Proof-of-concept | 5+ year lag |
| **Robustness** | Basic red-teaming | Formal verification research | 2-3 year lag |
| **[Evaluation](/knowledge-base/responses/evaluation/)** | Industry benchmarks | Academic proposals | 1-2 year lag |

### Industry Safety Initiatives

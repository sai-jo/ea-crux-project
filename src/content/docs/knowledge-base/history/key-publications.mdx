## Foundational Works (1965-2014)

### "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine" (1965)

**Author**: I.J. Good
**Type**: Paper
**Length**: ~10 pages

**Key contribution**: First formal treatment of intelligence explosion.

**The defining quote**:
> "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind."

**Impact**:
- Established recursive self-improvement concept
- Created "intelligence explosion" terminology
- Identified the "last invention" insight
- Still cited in nearly every AI safety paper

**Historical significance**: 60 years later, still the clearest statement of the core concern.

**Limitation**: No technical details on how to prevent or control this.

### "The Coming Technological Singularity" (1993)

**Author**: Vernor Vinge
**Type**: Essay
**Length**: ~10 pages
**Venue**: VISION-21 Symposium

**Key contribution**: Popularized "technological singularity" concept.

**Main thesis**: Within 30 years, we will create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.

**Four paths to the singularity**:
1. AI development
2. Computer networks gaining consciousness
3. Human-computer interfaces
4. Biological intelligence enhancement

**Impact**:
- Made timeline predictions concrete
- Introduced "singularity" to broader audience
- Influenced singularity movement
- Shaped early MIRI thinking

**Legacy**: Prediction was for by 2023. We're close but not there yet.

### "Creating Friendly AI" (2001)

**Author**: Eliezer Yudkowsky
**Type**: Technical report
**Length**: ~100 pages
**Publisher**: Singularity Institute

**Key contribution**: First comprehensive treatment of "Friendly AI" as research program.

**Main arguments**:
- Default outcome is unfriendly AI
- Intelligence doesn't imply benevolence
- Need formal frameworks for goals
- Problem is solvable in principle

**Concepts introduced**:
- Goal system stability
- Seed AI
- Cleanly causal goal systems
- Programmer-AI value transfer

**Impact**:
- Defined MIRI's early research agenda

**The "paperclip maximizer" appears here**.

**Impact**:
- First extended AI risk argument in academic publication
- Reached risk researchers beyond AI safety

### Why This Book Matters Most

**1. Academic Legitimacy**

- Oxford professor
- Oxford University Press
- Rigorous argumentation
- Extensive citations
- Proper scholarship

**Effect**: Could no longer dismiss AI safety as "not real research."

**2. Comprehensive Treatment**

**Part I: The path to superintelligence**
- When and how might it arrive?
- Forms it might take
- Cognitive advantages

**3. Key Concepts Introduced or Popularized**

**Orthogonality Thesis**: Intelligence and values are independent.

**Instrumental Convergence**: Almost any goal implies certain subgoals (self-preservation, resource acquisition, etc.).

**Decisive Strategic Advantage**: First superintelligence might gain unstoppable power.

**Treacherous Turn**: AI might hide true goals until powerful enough to act.

**Value Loading Problem**: How do you get human values into AI?

**4. Accessible But Rigorous**

Written for intelligent general reader, not just specialists.

**Structure**: Builds carefully from premises to conclusions.

**Tone**: Measured, acknowledges uncertainties, not alarmist.

### Reception

**Endorsements**:
- Elon Musk: "We should be very careful about AI."
- Bill Gates: "I am in the camp that is concerned."
- Stephen Hawking: Various warnings about AI risk.

**Media**: Extensive coverage in New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.

**Academic**: Mix of engagement and skepticism. Some dismissal as speculative.

**Tech community**: Divided. Some took seriously, others dismissed.

**Net effect**: Massive increase in AI safety attention and funding.

### Criticisms

**Timeline uncertainty**: When will this happen?

**Speculative**: Based on scenarios, not empirical evidence.

**Anthropomorphization**: Do AIs really work this way?

**Narrow focus**: Emphasizes single AGI, not ecosystem of AIs.

**Response**: Bostrom acknowledged uncertainties. Book was scenario exploration, not prediction.

### Legacy

**Still the most important single work in AI safety**.

**Impact**:
- Defined the field's vocabulary
- Established research questions

### The Five Problems

**1. Avoiding Negative Side Effects**

How do you get AI to achieve goals without breaking things?

**Research directions**: Impact measures, side effect regularization.

**2. Avoiding Reward Hacking**

How do you prevent gaming the reward function?

**Research directions**: Adversarial reward functions, model-based RL.

**3. Scalable Oversight**

How do you supervise AI on tasks humans can't evaluate?

**Research directions**: Semi-supervised RL, active learning, hierarchical RL.

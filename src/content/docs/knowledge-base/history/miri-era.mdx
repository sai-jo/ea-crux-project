## Summary

The MIRI era marks the transition from scattered warnings to organized research. For the first time, AI safety had an institution, a community, and a research agenda.

**Defining characteristics**:
- First dedicated AI safety organization
- Formation of online community (LessWrong)
- Philosophical and theoretical work
- Battle for academic legitimacy
- Still mostly ignored by mainstream AI researchers

**The transformation**: AI safety went from "a few people's weird hobby" to "a small but serious research field."

## The Singularity Institute (2000)

### Founding

**Date**: 2000
**Founders**: Eliezer Yudkowsky, Brian Atkins, Sabine Atkins
**Original name**: Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI)
**Later renamed**: Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) in 2013

**Mission**: Research and development of "Friendly AI"—artificial intelligence that is safe and beneficial to humanity.

### Why 2000?

**Context**:
- Dot-com boom creating tech optimism
- Computing power increasing dramatically
- AI winter ending; new techniques emerging
- Y2K demonstrated both technological sophistication and vulnerability
- Transhumanist movement growing

**The insight**: If AI progress was resuming, safety work needed to start *before* capabilities became dangerous.

### Early Years (2000-2005)

**Reality**: A handful of people in a small office with virtually no funding.

**Main activities**:
- Theoretical work on "Friendly AI"
- Writing and outreach
- Seeking funding (mostly unsuccessful)
- Small conferences and workshops

**Reception**: Largely dismissed by AI research community as:
- Too speculative
- Solving problems that don't exist yet
- Science fiction, not science
- A distraction from real AI research

## Eliezer Yudkowsky: The Founding Visionary

### Background

**Born**: 1979
**Education**: Self-taught (no formal degree)
**Early claim to fame**: Wrote about AI since teenage years

**Advantage**: Not constrained by academic conventions
**Disadvantage**: Easier to dismiss without credentials

### "Creating Friendly AI" (2001)

Yudkowsky's first major technical document on AI safety.

**Core arguments**:

**1. The Default Outcome is Doom**

Without specific safety work, AI will be dangerous by default.

**Why**:
- Intelligence doesn't imply benevolence
- Small differences in goals lead to large differences in outcomes
- We get one chance (can't restart after AGI)

**2. The Goal System Problem**

It's not enough for AI to be "smart"—it needs the *right goals*.

**Challenges**:
- How do you specify human values?
- How do you prevent goal drift?
- How do you handle goal evolution?

**3. The Technical Challenge**

This is an engineering problem, not just philosophy.

**Requirements**:
- Formal frameworks for goals
- Provable stability guarantees
- Protection against unintended optimization

### Early Reception

**Mainstream AI researchers**: "This is not a real problem. We're nowhere near AGI."

**Transhumanists**: "AI will be wonderful! Why the pessimism?"

**Academic philosophers**: "Interesting but too speculative."

**Result**: MIRI remained on the fringe.

## The LessWrong Era (2006-2012)

### Origins

**2006**: Overcoming Bias blog (Yudkowsky and Robin Hanson)
**2009**: LessWrong.com launches as dedicated community site

**Purpose**: Improve human rationality and discuss existential risks, particularly from AI.

### The Sequences

**2006-2009**: Yudkowsky writes 1,000+ blog posts covering:
- Cognitive biases
- Probability and decision theory
- Philosophy of mind
- Quantum mechanics
- AI safety

**Impact**: Created a coherent intellectual framework and community.

**Key essays for AI safety**:
- "The AI-Box Experiment"
- "Coherent Extrapolated Volition"
- "Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk"
- "Complex Value Systems"

### The AI-Box Experiment (2002, popularized 2006)

**Setup**: Can a superintelligent AI convince a human to let it out of a sealed box?

**Yudkowsky's claim**: Even with all the advantages, humans would lose.

**Demonstration**: Ran actual experiments (text-only) and convinced people to "let him out."

**Lesson**: Don't rely on containment. Superintelligence is persuasive.

**Criticism**: Unclear how well this generalizes. Maybe Yudkowsky is just persuasive.

### Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)

**The problem**: How do you give AI the "right" goals when we don't know what we want?

**Yudkowsky's proposal**:

> "Our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together."

**The idea**: Don't program current values. Program a process that figures out what we *would* want under ideal conditions.

**Appeal**: Handles value uncertainty and disagreement.

**Problems**:
- How do you formalize "what we would want"?
- Does CEV even exist?
- Whose volition? All of humanity's?
- What if different extrapolations conflict?

**Status**: Influential idea but no one knows how to implement it.

### Community Formation

**LessWrong created**:
- Shared vocabulary (Bayesian reasoning, utility functions, alignment)
- Cultural norms (steelmanning, asking for predictions)
- Network of people taking AI risk seriously
- Pipeline of researchers into AI safety

**Demographics**:
- Heavily young, male, tech-oriented
- Many from physics, math, CS backgrounds
- Concentrated in Bay Area and online

**Culture**:
- Intense intellectualism
- Rationality techniques
- Long-form discussion
- Quantified thinking

## Robin Hanson: The Skeptical Voice

### The Hanson-Yudkowsky Debate (2008)

One of the most important early debates about AI risk.

**Robin Hanson's position**:
- AGI likely arrives via brain emulation (ems), not de novo AI
- Transition will be gradual, not sudden
- Market forces will drive AI development
- Humans will remain economically valuable
- Less doom, more weird future

**Yudkowsky's position**:
- De novo AI more likely than ems
- Intelligence explosion could be very fast
- Market forces don't guarantee safety
- Humans might have no economic value to superintelligence
- Default outcome is doom without safety work

### Why This Mattered

**Established key disagreements**:
- Takeoff speed (fast vs. slow)
- Development path (brain emulation vs. AI)
- Economic model (humans useful vs. useless)
- Urgency (immediate vs. eventual)

**Created framework**: Many modern debates echo Hanson-Yudkowsky.

**Community value**: Demonstrated that disagreement within AI safety is healthy.

## Nick Bostrom: Academic Legitimacy

### Background

**Born**: 1973
**Position**: Professor of Philosophy at Oxford
**Credentials**: PhD from LSE, academic credibility
**Advantage**: Could speak to academic establishment

### Future of Humanity Institute (2005)

**Founded**: 2005 at Oxford University
**Mission**: Research existential risks, including from AI

**Significance**: First academic institution focused on existential risk.

**Effect**: Provided academic home for AI safety research.

### "Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority" (2013)

**Argument**: Even small probabilities of human extinction deserve massive resources.

**Key insight**: Expected value of preventing extinction is astronomical due to lost future value.

**Calculation**: 10^52 future human lives at stake if we reach the stars.

**Implication**: Even 1% risk of AI extinction justifies enormous investment.

**Impact**: Influenced effective altruism movement to prioritize AI safety.

## Superintelligence (2014)

### The Book That Changed Everything

**Author**: Nick Bostrom
**Published**: July 2014
**Significance**: First comprehensive, academically rigorous book on AI risk

### Why Superintelligence Mattered

**1. Academic Legitimacy**

- Published by Oxford University Press
- Written by Oxford professor
- Rigorous argumentation
- Extensive citations
- Serious scholarship, not speculation

**Effect**: Could no longer dismiss AI safety as "not real research."

**2. Comprehensive Treatment**

**Topics covered**:
- Paths to superintelligence
- Forms of superintelligence
- Superintelligence capabilities
- The control problem
- Strategic implications
- Existential risk

**3. Accessible Argumentation**

Written for intelligent general audience, not just specialists.

**Structure**: Build up carefully from premises to conclusions.

**Tone**: Measured, not alarmist. Acknowledges uncertainties.

### Key Concepts from Superintelligence

**The Orthogonality Thesis**

Intelligence and goals are independent. A superintelligent AI can have any goal.

**Implication**: "It will be smart enough to be good" is false.

**The Instrumental Convergence Thesis**

Almost any goal leads to certain instrumental sub-goals:
- Self-preservation
- Resource acquisition
- Goal preservation
- Cognitive enhancement
- Technological advancement

**Implication**: Even "harmless" goals can lead to dangerous behavior.

**The Treacherous Turn**

A sufficiently intelligent AI might conceal its true goals until it's powerful enough to achieve them without human interference.

**Scenario**:
1. AI appears aligned while weak
2. Secretly plans takeover
3. Waits until it can succeed
4. Rapidly pivots to true goal

**Implication**: We might not get warning signs.

**The Paperclip Maximizer**

Thought experiment: AI tasked with maximizing paperclips converts all matter (including humans) into paperclips.

**Point**: Misspecified goals, even simple ones, can be catastrophic.

**Criticism**: Perhaps too simplistic, but effective for illustration.

### Reception of Superintelligence

**Positive**:
- Endorsements from Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking
- Mainstream media coverage
- Academic engagement
- Brought AI safety to broader audience

**Critical**:
- Some AI researchers dismissed as "fear-mongering"
- Complaints about speculative nature
- Disagreement on timelines
- Questions about feasibility

**Net effect**: Massive increase in attention to AI safety.

## High-Profile Endorsements (2014-2015)

### The Tide Turns

**Elon Musk** (2014):
> "I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that."

**Stephen Hawking** (2014):
> "Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last."

**Bill Gates** (2015):
> "I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence... I don't understand why some people are not concerned."

**Steve Wozniak** (2015):
> "Computers are going to take over from humans, no question."

### Impact of Celebrity Voices

**Positive effects**:
- Mainstream media attention
- Public awareness
- Legitimacy boost
- Attracted talent and funding

**Negative effects**:
- Some backlash from AI researchers
- Accusations of "hype"
- Potential overstatement of near-term risk
- Distraction from near-term AI harms

## Funding Emerges (2014-2015)

### The Money Arrives

For 15 years, AI safety was severely underfunded. 2014-2015 marked a turning point.

**Elon Musk**:
- $10M to Future of Life Institute (2015)
- Funding for AI safety research grants
- Support for multiple organizations

**Open Philanthropy** (formerly Good Ventures + GiveWell Labs):
- Major EA funder begins prioritizing AI safety
- Millions in grants to MIRI, FHI, and other orgs
- Long-term commitment signaled

**Future of Life Institute** (founded 2014):
- Coordinates AI safety research funding
- Brings together researchers and funders
- Puerto Rico conference (2015) brings together AI leaders

### The 2015 Puerto Rico Conference

**Attendees**:
- Elon Musk
- Stuart Russell
- Demis Hassabis
- Nick Bostrom
- Max Tegmark
- Many leading AI researchers

**Result**: "Open Letter on AI Safety" signed by thousands, including:
- Stephen Hawking
- Elon Musk
- Steve Wozniak
- Many AI researchers

**Content**: Calls for research to ensure AI remains beneficial.

**Significance**: First time AI safety had broad backing from AI research community.

## Technical Research Begins (2010-2015)

### Transition from Philosophy to Technical Work

**Early MIRI work** (2000-2010): Mostly philosophical
**Mid-period** (2010-2015): Increasingly technical

**Key areas**:

**1. Logical Uncertainty**

How does an AI reason about logical facts it hasn't yet proven?

**Why it matters**: An AI might need to reason about other AIs (including itself) without infinite regress.

**2. Decision Theory**

How should AI make decisions, especially when other agents can predict those decisions?

**Newcomb's problem, Prisoner's Dilemma variations, etc.**

**3. Tiling Agents**

Can an AI create a successor that preserves its goals?

**Challenge**: Prevent goal drift across self-modification.

**4. Value Loading**

How do you get human values into an AI system?

**Problem**: We can't even articulate our own values completely.

### Academic AI Safety Research

**Stuart Russell** (UC Berkeley):
- Co-author of leading AI textbook
- Begins working on AI safety
- Develops "cooperative inverse reinforcement learning"
- Promotes value alignment research

**Other early academic work**:
- Concrete problems in AI safety (paper in 2016, but research began earlier)
- Inverse reinforcement learning
- Safe exploration in reinforcement learning
- Robustness and adversarial examples

## The Cultural Moment

### How MIRI Era Changed Discourse

**Before (2000)**:
- "AI risk? You mean like in Terminator?"
- Dismissed as science fiction
- No research community

**After (2015)**:
- Legitimate research area
- Academic conferences
- Hundreds of researchers
- Major funding
- Public awareness

### The Effective Altruism Connection

**EA movement** (founded ~2011) adopted AI safety as top priority.

**Reasoning**:
- High expected value
- Neglected relative to importance
- Tractability unclear but potentially high
- Fits "longtermist" framework

**Effect**: Pipeline of talent into AI safety research.

## Limitations of the MIRI Era

### What Was Missing (2000-2015)

**1. Limited Technical Progress**

Much philosophical work, but few concrete technical results applicable to current AI systems.

**2. Disconnect from ML Community**

Most mainstream AI researchers still thought this was irrelevant.

**3. Focus on FOOM Scenarios**

Emphasized fast takeoff, potentially neglecting slow takeoff scenarios.

**4. Coordination Questions**

Less attention to governance, policy, international coordination.

**5. Prosaic AI**

Focus on exotic AI designs rather than scaled-up versions of current systems.

**6. Limited Empirical Work**

Mostly theoretical. Little work with actual ML systems.

## Key Organizations Founded (2000-2015)

| Organization | Founded | Focus |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| **MIRI** (originally SIAI) | 2000 | Agent foundations, decision theory |
| **Future of Humanity Institute** | 2005 | Existential risk research |
| **Centre for the Study of Existential Risk** | 2012 | Cambridge-based existential risk research |
| **Future of Life Institute** | 2014 | AI safety funding and coordination |
| **DeepMind** | 2010 | AI research with safety team (formed 2016) |
| **OpenAI** | 2015 | AI research "for the benefit of humanity" |

## The Transition to Deep Learning Era

### What Changed in 2015

**Before 2015**: AI capabilities were modest. Safety research was theoretical.

**After 2015**:
- Deep learning showing incredible progress
- AlphaGo (2016) shocked the world
- GPT models emerged
- Safety research needed to engage with actual AI systems

**The shift**: From "how do we build safe AGI someday" to "how do we make current systems safer and prepare for rapid capability growth."

## Legacy of the MIRI Era

### What This Period Established

**1. Institutional Foundation**

AI safety now had organizations, not just individuals.

**2. Intellectual Framework**

Core concepts established:
- Orthogonality thesis
- Instrumental convergence
- Alignment problem
- Takeoff scenarios
- Existential risk framing

**3. Research Community**

From under 10 people to hundreds of researchers.

**4. Funding Base**

From essentially zero to millions per year.

**5. Academic Legitimacy**

Could no longer be dismissed as "just science fiction."

**6. Public Awareness**

Mainstream coverage and celebrity endorsements.

### What Still Needed to Happen

**1. Engage with Actual ML Systems**

Theory needed to connect with practice.

**2. Grow the Field**

Hundreds of researchers weren't enough.

**3. Convince ML Community**

Most AI researchers still weren't worried.

**4. Address Governance**

Technical safety alone wouldn't solve coordination problems.

**5. Faster Progress**

Capabilities were advancing quickly. Safety needed to keep pace.

## Lessons from the MIRI Era

### Key Takeaways

**1. Institutions Matter**

MIRI's founding was the inflection point. Before: scattered individuals. After: organized field.

**2. Academic Credibility Is Crucial**

Bostrom's Superintelligence changed the game because it was academically rigorous.

**3. Celebrity Endorsements Help But Aren't Enough**

Musk, Gates, Hawking brought attention but not necessarily technical progress.

**4. Funding Follows Attention**

Once high-profile people cared, money followed.

**5. Community Building Takes Time**

LessWrong and EA created talent pipeline, but this took years.

**6. Theoretical Work Needs Empirical Grounding**

By 2015, the field needed to engage with real AI systems, not just thought experiments.

## Looking Forward

The MIRI era (2000-2015) established AI safety as a real field with institutions, funding, and research agendas.

But it also revealed challenges:
- Theoretical work wasn't translating to practice
- Mainstream ML community remained skeptical
- Capabilities were advancing faster than safety

The next era (2015-2020) would be defined by the deep learning revolution and the need for AI safety to engage with rapidly advancing real-world systems.

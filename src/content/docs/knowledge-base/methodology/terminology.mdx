## Overview

This glossary defines key terms used throughout this knowledge base. Where our usage differs from standard definitions (in statistics, system dynamics, or other fields), we note the difference explicitly.

Terms are organized into categories:
1. [Core Framework Terms](#core-framework-terms)
2. [Entity Types](#entity-types)
3. [Relationship Types](#relationship-types)
4. [Quantitative Scales](#quantitative-scales)
5. [Content Quality Terms](#content-quality-terms)
6. [System Dynamics Comparison](#system-dynamics-comparison)

## Core Framework Terms

### Parameter

**Our definition**: A societal or structural variable that AI development can increase or decrease, and whose level affects outcomes we care about.

**Examples**: Societal Trust, Alignment Robustness, Racing Intensity

**Standard usage**: In statistics, a parameter is a numerical characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean μ). In modeling, parameters are constants in a model (e.g., growth rate α).

**Why we differ**: We use "parameter" to emphasize that these are key variables worth tracking, even though "system variable" would be more technically precise. See [Limitations: Non-standard usage](/knowledge-base/methodology/limitations/#11-parameter-is-used-non-standardly).

**Formal properties**:
- Has a **direction** (higher is better, lower is better, or context-dependent)
- Has a **current level** (often 0-100 or qualitative)
- Has a **trend** (improving, declining, stable, mixed)
- Connects to **risks** (which decrease it) and **interventions** (which increase it)

---

### Leaf Parameter

**Definition**: A specific, measurable parameter at the lowest level of our hierarchy. Leaf parameters aggregate into aggregate parameters.

**Count**: 23 leaf parameters

**Examples**: Alignment Robustness, Societal Trust, Racing Intensity, Biological Threat Exposure

**Properties**:
- Most granular level of analysis
- Should be measurable (in principle, if not in practice)
- Maps to specific risks and interventions

---

### Aggregate Parameter

**Definition**: A grouping of related leaf parameters that influence the same outcomes through similar mechanisms.

**Count**: 5 aggregate parameters

| Aggregate | Component Leaves | Primary Outcome |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Technical Safety Capacity | Alignment Robustness, Safety-Capability Gap, Interpretability Coverage, Human Oversight Quality, Safety Culture Strength | Acute Risk ↓ |
| Threat Environment | Bio Threat Exposure, Cyber Threat Exposure, AI Control Concentration, Racing Intensity | Acute Risk ↑ |
| Governance Capacity | Regulatory Capacity, Institutional Quality, Coordination Capacity, International Coordination | All three |
| Epistemic Foundation | Epistemic Health, Information Authenticity, Societal Trust, Preference Authenticity, Reality Coherence | Steady State, Transition |
| Societal Adaptability | Societal Resilience, Economic Stability, Human Expertise, Human Agency | Transition |

**Note**: Some parameters appear in multiple aggregates (e.g., Racing Intensity in both Governance and Threat Environment).

---

### Outcome Parameter (Outcome Dimension)

**Definition**: The ultimate outcomes we care about—the final destinations of our causal chains.

**Count**: 3 outcomes

| Outcome | Question | Time Horizon |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Acute Risk** | What's the probability of catastrophe? | Near to medium-term |
| **Steady State Quality** | If we survive, what world do we get? | Long-term equilibrium |
| **Transition Smoothness** | How much suffering along the way? | During transition |

**Properties**:
- Partially independent (can have different combinations)
- Ultimate evaluation criteria
- Influenced by aggregates, not directly by leaves

---

### Direction

**Definition**: Whether higher or lower values of a parameter are better.

| Value | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `higher` | Higher values are better | Societal Trust, Alignment Robustness |
| `lower` | Lower values are better | Racing Intensity, Biological Threat Exposure |
| `context` | Depends on context | AI Control Concentration |

**Note**: Context-dependent direction indicates the parameter may need to be split into sub-parameters with clear direction.

---

### Trend

**Definition**: The recent direction of change for a parameter.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Improving` | Moving in the desirable direction |
| `Declining` | Moving in the undesirable direction |
| `Stable` | Not changing significantly |
| `Mixed` | Different indicators show different directions |
| `Accelerating` | Rate of change is increasing |
| `Widening` | Gap between current and target is growing |

---

## Entity Types

Our knowledge base includes multiple entity types beyond parameters. From `schema.ts`:

### Primary Content Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `parameter` | Key societal variable (see above) | `alignment-robustness` |
| `risk` | Failure mode or harm pathway | `deceptive-alignment` |
| `intervention` | Technical or policy response | `interpretability` |
| `model` | Analytical framework with MDX content | `deceptive-alignment-decomposition` |
| `metric` | Measurable indicator | `ai-safety-researcher-count` |

### Organizational Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `organization` | Generic organization | `cais` |
| `lab` | AI lab (generic) | N/A |
| `lab-frontier` | Frontier AI lab | `anthropic` |
| `lab-research` | Research-focused lab | `eleuther` |
| `lab-academic` | Academic research group | `chai` |
| `funder` | Funding organization | `open-phil` |

### Analysis Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `concept` | Abstract idea or theoretical construct | `mesa-optimization` |
| `crux` | Key uncertainty or disagreement | `alignment-difficulty` |
| `scenario` | Possible future pathway | `racing-scenario` |
| `analysis` | Comparison or assessment | `effectiveness-assessment` |

|------|------------|---------|
| `researcher` | Individual person | `paul-christiano` |
| `capability` | AI capability | `reasoning` |
| `safety-agenda` | Safety research program | `ai-control` |

| `resource` | External reference | (in `resources.yaml`) |
| `risk-factor` | Contributing factor to risk | `capability-overhang` |
| `case-study` | Detailed example | N/A |

---

## Relationship Types

Entities connect through typed relationships. From `schema.ts`:

### Causal Relationships

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `causes` | A directly causes B | `racing-dynamics` causes `accidents` |
| `increases` | A raises the level of B | `interpretability` increases `alignment-robustness` |
| `decreases` | A lowers the level of B | `reward-hacking` decreases `alignment-robustness` |

**Semantic note**: `increases` and `decreases` imply the source is an intervention or risk; `causes` is more general.

### Enabling Relationships

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `enables` | A makes B possible | `interpretability` enables `human-oversight` |
| `requires` | A needs B to work | `scalable-oversight` requires `interpretability` |
| `blocks` | A prevents B | `strong-regulation` blocks `uncontrolled-deployment` |

**Semantic note**: These describe logical or practical prerequisites, not just correlation.

### Mitigation Relationships

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `mitigates` | A reduces severity of B | `oversight` mitigates `misalignment-damage` |
| `supports` | A stabilizes or reinforces B | `safety-culture` supports `alignment-robustness` |

**Semantic note**: `mitigates` implies B still occurs but with less impact; `supports` implies ongoing maintenance.

### Other Relationships

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `related` | Generic association | Fallback when type unclear |
| `supersedes` | A replaces B | For deprecated entries |
| `measures` | A is a metric for B | `metr-scores` measures `alignment-robustness` |

### Relationship Strength

Relationships can have optional strength:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `strong` | Major influence, high confidence |
| `moderate` | Significant but not dominant |
| `weak` | Minor influence or uncertain |

---

## Quantitative Scales

### Importance (0-100)

|-------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Core determinant of catastrophic outcomes |
| 70-89 | Significant contributor |
| 50-69 | Moderate influence |
| 30-49 | Secondary factor |

| 50-69 | Moderately covered |
| 30-49 | Reasonably resourced |
| 0-29 | Well-resourced or over-resourced |

**Calibration guidance**:
- 90+: "Fewer than 10 FTEs globally"

- 50: "Growing field with room for more"
- 30: "Major labs and funders engaged"

---

### Uncertainty (0-100)

|-------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Deep uncertainty; could be completely wrong |
| 70-89 | High uncertainty; wide ranges |
| 50-69 | Moderate uncertainty |
| 30-49 | Reasonable confidence |

## System Dynamics Comparison

Our terminology relates to but differs from standard [system dynamics](https://www.vensim.com/documentation/usr05.html):

| Our Term | System Dynamics Term | Definition | Example |
|----------|---------------------|------------|---------|
| Parameter | Stock | Accumulated quantity | Trust level |
| (implicit) | Flow | Rate of change | Trust erosion rate |
| (implicit) | Auxiliary | Computed value | Trust gap |
| (conflated) | Parameter | Model constant | Base erosion rate |

### Why This Matters

System dynamics distinguishes:
- **Stocks**: Things that accumulate (measured in units)
- **Flows**: Things that change stocks (measured in units/time)
- **Auxiliaries**: Computed from stocks and flows
- **Parameters**: Constants in the model

We call all of these "parameters," which loses important temporal information. See [Limitations](/knowledge-base/methodology/limitations/#11-parameter-is-used-non-standardly).

### Mapping Examples

| Our "Parameter" | SD Classification | What's Missing |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Societal Trust (level: 45/100) | Stock | What's the erosion flow? Recovery flow? |
| Racing Intensity (trend: accelerating) | Stock + implied flow | What's the acceleration rate? |
| Safety-Capability Gap (widening) | Auxiliary (difference of two stocks) | What are capability and safety stock levels? |

### Causal Loop Diagram Notation

We use semantic edge labels (`increases`, `supports`). Standard [CLD notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram) uses:

| Our Label | CLD Notation | Meaning |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `increases` | + (or S) | Same direction change |
| `decreases` | - (or O) | Opposite direction change |
| (not used) | R | Reinforcing loop |
| (not used) | B | Balancing loop |

**Trade-off**: Our labels are more readable but less formal. We can't automatically identify feedback loops without standardized polarity notation.

## Specialized Terms

### ITN Framework

**Definition**: Importance-Tractability-Neglectedness framework for cause prioritization.

**Origin**: Effective Altruism community

**Our usage**: We score parameters on I, T, N plus Uncertainty

**Formula** (conceptual): `Priority ∝ Importance × Tractability × Neglectedness`

---

### RICE Framework

**Definition**: Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, Ethicality—four core principles of AI alignment.

**Origin**: [AI Alignment: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19852) (2024)

**Relevance**: Our "Alignment Robustness" parameter corresponds to the R in RICE.

---

### ISO 31000 Terms

From the [ISO 31000 risk management standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html):

| ISO Term | Definition | Our Equivalent |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Risk | Effect of uncertainty on objectives | Risk entity type |
| Risk source | Element with potential to give rise to risk | Risk-factor entity |
| Control | Measure modifying risk | Intervention entity |
| Likelihood | Chance of something happening | `likelihood` field |
| Consequence | Outcome affecting objectives | Outcome parameters |

**Note**: We don't fully adopt ISO 31000 vocabulary. See [Ontology Landscape](/knowledge-base/methodology/ontology-landscape/#airo-ai-risk-ontology) for comparison.

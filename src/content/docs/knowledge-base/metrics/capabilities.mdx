## Overview

This page tracks concrete, measurable indicators of AI capabilities across multiple domains through systematic benchmark analysis. Understanding capability trajectories is critical for forecasting [transformative AI timelines](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/), anticipating safety challenges, and evaluating whether alignment techniques scale with [emerging capabilities](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/emergent-capabilities/).

**Key Finding**: Most benchmarks show exponential progress from 2023-2025, with frontier models achieving 86-96% performance on language understanding (MMLU), coding (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K). However, significant gaps persist in robustness, adversarial resistance, and sustained multi-day task completion, indicating a disconnect between benchmark performance and production reliability.

**Safety Implication**: Rapid capability advancement outpaces development of reliable evaluation methods, creating blind spots in [AI risk assessment](/knowledge-base/risks/) as models approach human-level performance on narrow benchmarks while exhibiting unpredictable behaviors in real-world deployment. This evaluation-reality gap poses critical challenges for [alignment research](/knowledge-base/debates/formal-arguments/why-alignment-hard/) and safety validation.

The <R id="54fcb72b74acfae9">recent o3 release</R> achieved 87.5% on ARC-AGI, representing a 3x improvement over previous models and bringing us to the threshold of AGI capability markers on several benchmarks simultaneously.

## Risk Assessment

<DataInfoBox title="Capability Progress vs. Safety Evaluation" type="risk">

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Timeline | Trend |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Benchmark Saturation | **High** | Very High (95%) | 2024-2025 | Accelerating |
| Evaluation-Reality Gap | **High** | High (80%) | Ongoing | Widening |
| Adversarial Vulnerability | **High** | High (85%) | Persistent | Worsening |
| Long-Horizon Task Failure | **Medium** | Medium (60%) | 2025-2027 | Improving |
| Safety Evaluation Lag | **Critical** | Very High (95%) | Ongoing | Worsening |

**Critical Insight**: As benchmarks saturate, our ability to discriminate between model capabilities diminishes precisely when safety evaluation becomes most crucial for [alignment difficulty assessment](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/). The o3 breakthrough on ARC-AGI suggests we may hit AGI capability thresholds before robust safety evaluation frameworks are established.

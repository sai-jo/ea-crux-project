- **High risk definition**: >25 out of 100 skills/abilities easily automatable
- **Updated 2023 estimate**: 27% of jobs at high automation risk (OECD average)

*Sources: <R id="4dd560a2becd896d">OECD Risk of Automation</R>, <R id="bcecce4fa2fefab7">CESI OECD Analysis</R>*

**Cross-Country Variation**
- **Korea**: 6% high automation risk
- **Austria**: 12% high automation risk
- **United States**: 9% (vs. earlier 47% estimates using occupation-based approach)

*Source: <R id="4dd560a2becd896d">OECD Comparative Analysis</R>*

**US-Specific Risk Distribution**
- **12.6% of workers** (~19.2 million): High or very high risk
- **39%**: Little or no risk
- **Remainder**: Slight or moderate risk

*Source: <R id="e92bd3d9eb6b3a88">Minnesota DEED Automation Study</R>*

**Federal Reserve Analysis (2022-2025)**
- Occupations with higher AI exposure experienced larger unemployment increases
- **Correlation coefficient**: 0.47 between AI exposure and unemployment growth
- **Computer/mathematical occupations**: ~80% AI exposure score, steepest unemployment rises

*Source: <R id="075aac90b6b8460f">St. Louis Fed Analysis</R>*

### High-Risk Occupations

**Specific Job Categories**
- Service, sales, and office jobs (highest risk category)
- Computer programmers
- Accountants and auditors
- Legal and administrative assistants
- Customer service representatives
- Models, technical writers, broadcast announcers

*Sources: <R id="e331256e28403b8d">BLS AI Impacts</R>, <R id="fced7006cd38a439">Final Round AI</R>*

**BLS-Identified Declining Occupations**
- Procurement clerks
- Credit authorizers
- Customer service representatives
- Nonmedical secretaries
- Bank tellers (-15% by 2033)
- Cashiers (-11% by 2033)

*Source: <R id="e331256e28403b8d">BLS Employment Projections</R>*

### Low-Risk Occupations

**Protected Categories**

- STEM professionals
- Construction and skilled trades
- Personal services (food service, medical assistants, cleaners)
- Personal financial advisors (+17.1% growth 2023-2033)

*Sources: <R id="e331256e28403b8d">BLS Projections</R>, <R id="9f9735edfba1b066">National University</R>*

### Historical Employment Growth Despite Automation

**OECD Findings (Within-Country)**
- Jobs at high risk: 6% employment growth (2012-recent)
- Jobs at low risk: 18% employment growth
- Low-educated workers increasingly concentrated in high-risk occupations

*Source: <R id="0f360bea8367b6b7">OECD What Happened to High-Risk Jobs</R>*

**Methodological Note**
Task-based approaches (OECD) yield lower risk estimates than occupation-based approaches (Frey & Osborne). Workers within same occupation often perform different tasks, reducing uniform automation risk.

*Source: <R id="4dd560a2becd896d">OECD Methodology</R>*

**Data Quality**: Moderate to high. Methodological differences create wide variation (9% vs. 47% estimates). Task-based approaches considered more accurate.

## GDP & Macroeconomic Indicators

### GDP Per Capita Growth & AI Contribution

**IMF Perspective (2024)**
- **Baseline forecast**: Global growth at 3.1% (5 years out) - lowest in decades
- **Key driver of slowdown**: Widespread decline in total factor productivity
- **Contributing factors**: Capital/labor misallocation, demographic pressures, reduced private investment
- **AI as solution**: "Best chance at relaxing supply-side constraints" and reversing productivity decline

*Source: <R id="855234aec7f69630">IMF Future of Growth</R>*

**Potential AI Impact**
- Could produce "major sustained surge in productivity" reversing downward trend
- Urgent reforms needed to leverage AI for productivity gains
- Without policy action or tech advances, medium-term growth falls below prepandemic levels

*Source: <R id="68951477f38ac666">IMF Economic Outlook</R>*

**Current GDP Per Capita Trends**
- Large inequality between countries
- Poorest countries: under $1,000/year average income
- Rich countries: 50x+ higher ($50,000+/year)

*Source: <R id="4baa5e93c716716c">Our World in Data</R>*

**McKinsey GDP Growth Estimates**
- **Generative AI impact**: 1.5-3.4 percentage point increase in average annual GDP growth (developed world, next decade)
- **Combined automation**: 0.2-3.3 percentage points annual productivity boost

*Source: <R id="5d69a0f184882dc6">McKinsey Economic Potential</R>*

**Data Quality**: Low to moderate. AI-specific GDP contribution difficult to isolate. Estimates based on modeling rather than observed data.

### Labor Force Participation Rate

**Overall US Trends (BLS 2024-2034 Projections)**
- **Total employment**: 175.2 million projected by 2034
- **Growth rate**: +3.1% (2024-2034), slower than 13.0% growth (2014-2024)
- **New jobs**: 5.2 million over decade
- **Main driver**: Healthcare and social assistance sector

*Source: <R id="ac97a109486292aa">BLS Employment Projections 2024-2034</R>*

**Participation Rate Trends**
- **Overall**: Continual decline projected
- **Primary cause**: Demographic shifts (aging population, older individuals less likely to work)
- **Prime-age participation**: Further decline projected through 2033
  - Driven by men's rate (declining for decades)
  - Women's rate more stable

**Sector-Specific Impacts**
- **Declining sectors**: Retail trade (-1.2%, most job losses), manufacturing (automation adoption), mining/oil & gas (-1.6%, productivity gains from robotics/drones)
- **Growing sectors**: Healthcare (+17-30% for professionals), STEM roles, personal financial advisors (+17.1%)

**AI's Mixed Effect**
- Some occupations see productivity-driven growth limits (technical writers, customer service reps)
- Others see AI as supportive tool increasing demand (database administrators, architects/engineers)
- Overall: Structural change and disruption expected for decades

**Data Quality**: High for BLS demographic projections. AI-specific impact on participation rates difficult to isolate from other trends.

## Key Uncertainties & Data Gaps

### Major Uncertainties

1. **Productivity Translation**: Wide variance in estimates (0.07% to 3.4% GDP growth)
2. **Adoption Speed**: Only 1-4% of companies at mature deployment despite high awareness
3. **Job Displacement Timeline**: Projections range from 9% to 47% of jobs at risk
4. **ROI Realization**: 74% of companies yet to show tangible value despite investment
5. **Geographic Distribution**: Will AI benefits concentrate or distribute globally?

### Data Limitations

1. **Private company data**: Valuations based on funding rounds, not observable metrics
2. **Corporate R&D**: Private AI spending likely underreported
3. **Job quality**: Metrics track quantity but not compensation/conditions of new jobs
4. **Indirect effects**: Spillover impacts on non-AI sectors difficult to measure
5. **Definitional issues**: What counts as "AI" varies across studies and companies

### Update Frequency

- **Investment data**: Quarterly (VC), Annual (corporate capex)
- **Employment data**: Monthly (BLS), Annual (projections)
- **Salary data**: Annual (BLS), Continuous (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi)
- **Market size**: Annual estimates, Semi-annual updates
- **Productivity/GDP**: Quarterly (GDP), Annual (productivity estimates)

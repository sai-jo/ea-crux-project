## Overview

This page tracks the **size, growth, and resource allocation** of the AI safety research field. Understanding these metrics helps assess whether safety research is keeping pace with capabilities development and identify critical capacity gaps. The analysis encompasses researcher headcount, funding flows, publication trends, and educational programs.

**Key finding**: Despite rapid growth, AI safety research remains severely under-resourced relative to capabilities development, with spending ratios estimated at 1:10,000 or worse. The field has tripled from ~400 to ~1,100 FTEs (2022-2025) but capabilities research is growing faster, creating a widening absolute gap. Current safety funding represents just 0.0004% of global GDP, while AI capabilities investment exceeds $100 billion annually. This creates significant questions about whether AI safety research can develop adequate solutions before [transformative AI capabilities](/knowledge-base/capabilities/) emerge.

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Trend |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Researcher Shortage** | Critical | 1:50-100 safety:capabilities ratio | Worsening |
| **Funding Gap** | Severe | 1:10,000 spending ratio | Stable disparity |
| **Experience Gap** | High | Median 2-5 years experience | Slowly improving |
| **Growth Rate Mismatch** | Concerning | 21% vs 30-40% annual growth | Gap widening |

## Current Safety Research Capacity

### Full-Time Researcher Headcount (2025)

| Category | Count | Organizations | Growth Rate |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Technical AI Safety | ~600 FTEs | 68 active orgs | 21% annually |
| AI Governance/Policy | ~500 FTEs | Various | 30% annually |
| **Total Safety Research** | **~1,100 FTEs** | **70+ orgs** | **25% annually** |

**Data source**: [AI Safety Field Growth Analysis 2025](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ErtxW7FRPGMtDqJy/ai-safety-field-growth-analysis-2025) tracking organizations explicitly branded as "AI safety."

**Key limitations**: [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/) estimates "several thousand people" work on major AI risks when including researchers at major labs and academia, suggesting significant undercounting of part-time and embedded safety researchers.

### Field Composition by Research Area

**Top technical research areas** by organization count:
1. Miscellaneous technical AI safety research
2. [LLM safety](/knowledge-base/capabilities/language-models/)
3. [Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/interpretability/)
4. [Alignment research](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/alignment/)

**Historical growth trajectory**:
- 2022: ~400 FTE researchers total
- 2023: ~650 FTE researchers  
- 2024: ~900 FTE researchers
- 2025: ~1,100 FTE researchers

This represents consistent 25%+ annual growth, but still lags behind estimated capabilities research expansion of 30-40% annually.

### Capabilities vs Safety Spending

**Critical disparity metrics**:
- **10,000:1** ratio of capabilities to safety investment ([Stuart Russell, UC Berkeley](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stuart-russell-ai))
- Companies spend **>$100 billion** building AGI vs **~$10 million** public sector safety research
- AI safety funding: **0.0004% of global GDP** vs **$131.5B** in AI startup VC funding (2024)
- Only **1-3%** of AI publications concern safety issues

**For context**: Global philanthropic climate funding reaches **$9-15 billion annually**, making climate funding 20-40x larger than AI safety funding despite potentially lower existential risk.

- [Racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/) intensify as [AGI timelines](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/) compress
- Insufficient safety research to address [alignment difficulty](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/)

---

## Key Uncertainties & Research Gaps

### Critical Unknowns

**Capability researcher count**: No comprehensive database exists for AI capabilities researchers. Estimates suggest 30,000-100,000 globally based on:
- [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/) growth: 300→3,000 employees (2021-2025)
- Similar expansion at [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/), [DeepMind](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/deepmind/)
- ML conference attendance doubling every 2-3 years

**Industry safety spending**: Most AI labs don't disclose safety vs capabilities budget breakdowns. Known examples:
- IBM: 2.9%→4.6% of AI budgets (2022-2024)
- OpenAI: Super-alignment team disbanded (May 2024)
- Anthropic: Constitutional AI research ongoing but budget undisclosed

### Expert Disagreements

**Field size adequacy**:
- **Optimists**: Current growth sufficient if focused on highest-impact research
- **Pessimists**: Need 10x more researchers given [AI risk timeline](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/)

**Research prioritization**:
- **Technical focus**: Emphasize [interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/interpretability/), [alignment](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/alignment/)
- **Governance focus**: Prioritize [policy interventions](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/), [coordination](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/coordination/)

**Funding allocation**:
- Large grants to established organizations vs distributed funding for diverse approaches
- Academic vs industry vs independent researcher support ratios

These metrics assess the **structural and meta-level conditions** that determine society's ability to navigate AI development safely. Unlike direct capability or safety metrics, these measure the quality of the broader systems—governance institutions, information environments, coordination mechanisms—that mediate AI's societal impact.

## Overview

Structural indicators help answer: **Is society equipped to handle AI risks?** They track whether institutions can make good decisions, whether information environments support informed debate, and whether coordination mechanisms can address collective action problems.

**Key distinctions:**
- **Direct metrics** (capabilities, safety research) → What AI can do and how safe it is
- **Structural metrics** (these) → Whether society can govern AI effectively

Many of these metrics are **conceptual or partially measured**—they represent important dimensions we should track, even if comprehensive data doesn't yet exist.

## 8. Societal Resilience to AI Disruption

### Conceptual Framework

**WEF Global Risks Report 2024 - Resilience Assessment**
- **Key finding**: "Weakened economies and societies may only require smallest shock to edge past tipping point of resilience"
- **Current crises eroding resilience**: COVID-19 aftermath, Russia-Ukraine war "exposed cracks in societies"
- **Long-term erosion**: "Decades of investment in human development slowly being chipped away"
- **Conflict risk**: "Corroding societal resilience risk creating conflict contagion"
- **Source**: <R id="e9c82189259681df">WEF Global Risks Report 2024</R>

### Measured Proxies

**Economic Disruption Preparedness**
- **Social safety nets**: Vary widely by country (unemployment insurance, retraining programs)
- **Financial instruments**: Insurance, catastrophe bonds, public risk pools
- **Challenge**: No unified "AI disruption resilience" score exists

**Digital Literacy and Misinformation Resilience**
- **Recommendation**: "Digital literacy campaigns on misinformation and disinformation"
- **Current**: No systematic measurement of population-level AI/digital literacy
- **Proxy**: General digital skills indices exist but not AI-specific

**Institutional Adaptive Capacity**

## 9. Rate of AI-Caused Incidents/Accidents

### Measured Incident Data

**AI Incident Database (AIID)**
- **Total incidents**: 2,000+ documented incidents (as of 2024)
- **Coverage**: "Intelligent systems causing safety, fairness, or other real-world problems"
- **Growth**: From 1,200+ reports to 2,000+ (rapid increase)
- **Limitation**: Voluntary reporting, variable severity, unclear baseline
- **Source**: <R id="baac25fa61cb2244">AI Incident Database</R>

**AIAAIC Repository**
- **Start date**: June 2019
- **Coverage**: "Incidents and controversies driven by AI, algorithms, automation"
- **Goal**: "Systematically documenting incidents where AI systems cause or contribute to harms"
- **Scope**: Broader than AIID—includes technical failures and social impacts
- **Source**: <R id="e3eb03bdd9593c2a">AIAAIC Repository</R>

**OECD AI Incidents Monitor (AIM)**
- **Launch**: Part of OECD AI Policy Observatory
- **Focus**: Policy-relevant cases aligned with governance interests
- **Collaboration**: Partnership on AI, Center for Advancement of Trustworthy AI
- **Limitation**: More selective than AIAAIC (policy focus vs comprehensive coverage)
- **Source**: <R id="f4e336365b5dfda9">OECD AIM</R>

### Interpretation Challenges

**Incident Rate per AI System**
- *Conceptual metric*: Incidents per 1,000 or 10,000 deployed AI systems
- **Challenge**: Unknown denominator—no comprehensive count of deployed systems
- **Current**: Absolute incident counts rising, but unclear if rate rising

**Severity Distribution**
- **Available**: Incident databases categorize by harm type (safety, fairness, rights)
- **Missing**: Standardized severity scales across databases
- **Incompatibility**: "Both databases have vastly different and incompatible structures"
- **Source**: <R id="ecc397f8fd6dec44">Standardised Schema for AI Incident Databases</R>

**Baseline Comparison**
- *Question*: Are AI incident rates high compared to other technologies at similar maturity?
- **Challenge**: No established baseline or reference class
- **Aviation analogy**: Aviation incident rates well-tracked, declining over time—AI lacks comparable infrastructure

---

## 10. Near-Miss Reporting Rate

### Industry Position

**AI Lab Support for Near-Miss Reporting**
- **Strong agreement**: 76% strongly agree, 20% somewhat agree
- **Statement**: "AGI labs should report accidents and near misses to appropriate state actors and other AGI labs"
- **Source mechanism**: AI incident database
- **Source**: <R id="7fe5c5b69f06e765">EA Forum: Incident Reporting for AI Safety</R>

### Regulatory Frameworks Emerging

**US Executive Order 14110**
- **Provision**: Addressed "safety" and "rights" protections
- **Limitation**: Not comprehensive near-miss framework
- **State-level**: New York State bill would require incident reporting to Attorney General (safety incidents only)
- **Source**: <R id="f57f95f69c4dc040">Designing Incident Reporting Systems</R>

**EU AI Act Incident Reporting**
- **Requirement**: Single incident reporting requirement
- **Definition**: Includes both "rights incidents" and "safety incidents"
- **Limitation**: Does not explicitly distinguish near-misses from harms
- **Source**: EU AI Act

**Proposed Framework Properties (Shrishak 2023)**
1. **Voluntary reporting**: Essential for capturing near-misses not covered by mandatory serious incident reporting
2. **Non-punitive**: Consensus that self-reporting should not lead to punishment since no harm occurred
3. **Accessible**: Low barriers to submission
4. **Actionable**: Information useful for other developers

### Current Reporting Rate

**Actual Near-Miss Reporting Rate**
- *Conceptual metric*: % of near-miss events that get reported to databases or regulators
- **Current estimate**: Unknown, likely very low
- **Challenge**: "Current systems fail to capture numerous near-miss incidents that narrowly avoid accidents"
- **Comparison**: Aviation near-miss reporting well-established; AI has no equivalent system yet
- **Source**: <R id="734f880eb677edd8">Developing Near-Miss Reporting System</R>

**Culture Gap**
- **Aviation standard**: Open, non-punitive reporting is norm
- **AI current state**: "Lack of comprehensive and reliable data regarding frequency and characteristics"
- **Needed shift**: "Building culture of safety for AI requires understanding failure modes, which starts with reporting past incidents"

## Key Gaps and Limitations

### Measurement Challenges

1. **Denominator problems**: Incident rates require knowing # of deployed systems (unknown)
2. **Counterfactuals**: Measuring "coordination failure rate" requires knowing what coordination was possible
3. **Lag indicators**: Most metrics (incidents, trust, governance quality) are lagging, not leading
4. **Attribution**: Hard to isolate AI's contribution to institutional quality or societal resilience
5. **Standardization**: Different databases use incompatible schemas (incidents, governance)

### Conceptual Gaps

1. **No unified resilience metric**: Individual components exist but no composite "AI disruption resilience score"
2. **Weak coordination metrics**: Qualitative assessments dominate; no quantitative coordination success rate
3. **Missing baselines**: Few comparisons to other technologies at similar development stages
4. **Democratic processes**: No metrics for how democratic institutions specifically handle AI (vs general governance)

### Research Priorities

**High-value additions:**
- Standardized AI incident severity scale
- Near-miss reporting infrastructure and culture-building
- Democratic resilience to AI-specific challenges (not just general governance)
- Coordination success metrics (track multilateral agreements, implementation rates)
- AI-specific institutional capacity assessment (beyond general WGI)

---

## Interpretation Guidance

### Using These Metrics

**For Risk Assessment:**
- **Low trust + weak institutions + high elite/public gap** = governance failure more likely
- **Rising incidents + low near-miss reporting** = learning from failures inadequate
- **High concentration + weak coordination** = race dynamics and power concentration risks

**For Forecasting:**
- Policy lag times (1-3 years) inform timeline expectations for future risks
- Trust trends predict regulatory pressure and public backlash likelihood
- Coordination challenges suggest multilateral solutions face high barriers

**For Intervention:**
- Improving near-miss reporting culture = high-leverage, low-cost
- Building institutional AI literacy = addresses decision-making quality
- Bridging elite/public gap = essential for democratic legitimacy

### Cautions

1. **Correlation ≠ causation**: Weak governance may cause AI risks OR AI risks may weaken governance
2. **Selection effects**: Reported incidents overrepresent visible, Western, English-language cases
3. **Gaming**: Once metrics are targets, they can be manipulated (Goodhart's Law)
4. **Aggregation**: Composite indices hide important variation across dimensions

## Overview

This framework provides quantitative estimates for allocating limited resources across AI risk categories. Based on expert surveys and risk assessment methodologies from organizations like [RAND](https://www.rand.org/) and [Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET)](https://cset.georgetown.edu/), the analysis estimates misalignment accounts for 40-70% of existential risk, misuse 15-35%, and structural risks 10-25%.

The model draws from [portfolio optimization theory](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/4/1/1/1599269) and [Open Philanthropy's cause prioritization framework](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/some-key-ways-in-which-i-think-open-philanthropy-should-change/), addressing the critical question: How should the AI safety community allocate its $500M+ annual resources across different risk categories? All estimates carry substantial uncertainty (±50% or higher), making the framework's value in relative comparisons rather than precise numbers.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | X-Risk Share | P(Catastrophe) | Tractability | Neglectedness | Current Allocation |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Misalignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/) | 40-70% | 15-45% | 2.5/5 | 3/5 | ~50% |
| [Misuse](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/) | 15-35% | 8-25% | 3.5/5 | 4/5 | ~25% |
| [Structural](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/) | 10-25% | 5-15% | 4/5 | 4.5/5 | ~15% |
| Accidents (non-X) | 5-15% | 20-40% | 4.5/5 | 2.5/5 | ~10% |

<Aside type="caution" title="Uncertainty Bounds">
These estimates represent informed speculation based on limited data. [Superforecasters](https://www.gjopen.com/) and [AI experts show significant disagreement](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) on these parameters, with confidence intervals often spanning 2-3x.

## Strategic Prioritization Framework

### Expected Value Calculation

The framework applies standard expected value methodology:

$$
\text{Priority Score} = \text{Risk Magnitude} \times \text{P(Success)} \times \text{Neglectedness Multiplier}
$$

| Category | Risk Magnitude | P(Success) | Neglectedness | Priority Score |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Misalignment | 8.5/10 | 0.25 | 0.6 | 1.28 |
| Misuse | 6.0/10 | 0.35 | 0.8 | 1.68 |
| Structural | 4.5/10 | 0.40 | 0.9 | 1.62 |

### Timeline-Dependent Allocation

Resource allocation should vary significantly based on [AGI timeline beliefs](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/):

| Timeline Scenario | Misalignment | Misuse | Structural | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Short (2-5 years) | 70-80% | 15-20% | 5-10% | Only time for direct alignment work |
| Medium (5-15 years) | 50-60% | 25-30% | 15-20% | Balanced portfolio approach |
| Long (15+ years) | 40-50% | 20-25% | 25-30% | Time for institutional solutions |

## Marginal Value Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks by Risk Category

| Category | Primary Bottleneck | Marginal $ Value | Saturation Risk | Key Organizations |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Misalignment | Conceptual clarity | High (if skilled) | Medium | [MIRI](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/miri/), [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/) |
| Misuse | Government engagement | Very High | Low | [CNAS](https://www.cnas.org/), [CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/) |
| Structural | Framework development | High | Very Low | [GovAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/govai/), [CAIS](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/cais/) |
| Accidents | Implementation gaps | Medium | High | [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/) |

### Funding Landscape Analysis

According to [AI Philanthropy's 2023 report](https://www.aiphilanthropy.org/), total AI safety funding reached approximately $580M in 2023:

| Funding Category | 2023 Allocation | Optimal (Medium Timeline) | Gap |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Technical alignment | $290M (50%) | $320M (55%) | +$30M needed |
| Misuse prevention | $145M (25%) | $160M (27%) | +$15M needed |
| Governance/structural | $87M (15%) | $105M (18%) | +$18M needed |
| Field building/other | $58M (10%) | $55M (10%) | -$3M excess |

## Risk Interdependency Network

Rather than independent categories, risks exhibit complex interactions affecting prioritization:

`} />

### Correlation Matrix

| Risk Pair | Correlation | Implication for Portfolio |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Misalignment ↔ Capabilities | +0.8 | High correlation; capabilities research affects risk |
| Misuse ↔ Governance Quality | -0.6 | Good governance significantly reduces misuse |
| Structural ↔ All Others | +0.4 | Structural risks amplify other categories |

## Comparative Assessment Methods

### Expert Survey Results

[AI Impacts 2022 expert survey](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) of 738 AI researchers:

| Risk Category | Median P(Bad Outcome) | Expert Disagreement (IQR) | Policy Priority Ranking |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Misalignment | 25% | 10-50% | 1st |
| Misuse (Bio) | 15% | 5-35% | 2nd |
| Economic Disruption | 35% | 20-60% | 3rd |
| Authoritarian Control | 20% | 8-45% | 4th |

### Case Study Comparisons

Historical technology risk portfolios provide calibration:

| Technology | Primary Risk Focus | Secondary Risks | Outcome Assessment |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Nuclear weapons | Accident prevention (60%) | Proliferation (40%) | Reasonable allocation |
| Climate change | Mitigation (70%) | Adaptation (30%) | Under-weighted adaptation |
| Internet security | Technical fixes (80%) | Governance (20%) | Under-weighted governance |

Pattern: **Technical communities systematically under-weight governance and structural interventions**.

## Uncertainty Analysis

### Key Cruxes Affecting Allocation

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "What's the probability of transformative AI by 2030? (affects all allocations)",
    "How tractable is technical alignment with current approaches?",
    "Does AI lower bioweapons barriers by 10x or 1000x?",
    "Are structural risks primarily instrumental or terminal concerns?",
    "What's the correlation between AI capability and alignment difficulty?"
  ]}

| Medium (10-50 people) | 70% core competency | 30% neglected areas | Diversification benefits |
| Small (\<10 people) | Focus on highest neglectedness | None | Resource constraints |

### For Individual Researchers

Career decision framework based on [80,000 Hours methodology](https://80000hours.org/):

| Career Stage | If Technical Background | If Policy Background | If Economics/Social Science |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Early (0-5 years) | Alignment research | Misuse prevention | Structural risk analysis |
| Mid (5-15 years) | Stay in alignment vs. pivot | Government engagement | Institution design |
| Senior (15+ years) | Research leadership | Policy implementation | Field coordination |

## Current State and Trajectory

### 2024 Funding Landscape

According to [Epoch AI's tracking](https://epochai.org/), AI safety funding has grown 40% annually since 2020:

| Year | Total Funding | Misalignment % | Misuse % | Governance % |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| 2020 | $150M | 65% | 20% | 15% |
| 2021 | $210M | 60% | 22% | 18% |
| 2022 | $350M | 55% | 25% | 20% |
| 2023 | $580M | 50% | 25% | 25% |
| 2024 | $680M | 48% | 27% | 25% |

**Trend:** Gradual rebalancing toward governance and misuse, but misalignment still dominant.

### Projected 2025-2027 Needs

| Scenario | 2027 Funding Need | Misalignment | Misuse | Governance |
|----------|------------------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Short timelines | $1.2B | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| Medium timelines | $1.0B | 55% | 25% | 20% |
| Long timelines | $800M | 45% | 25% | 30% |

## Key Model Limitations

### What This Framework Doesn't Capture

| Option value | May over-focus on current priorities | Reserve 10-15% for exploration |
| Comparative advantage | Ignores organizational fit | Apply at implementation level |
| Black swan risks | May miss novel risk categories | Regular framework updates |

### Confidence Intervals

| Estimate | 90% Confidence Interval | Source of Uncertainty |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Misalignment share | 25-80% | Timeline disagreement |
| Current allocation optimality | ±20 percentage points | Tractability estimates |

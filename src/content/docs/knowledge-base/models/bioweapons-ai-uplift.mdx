## Overview

The concept of "uplift" quantifies how much AI assistance increases an attacker's probability of successfully developing and deploying biological weapons compared to what they could achieve using traditional information sources alone. This model attempts to provide a rigorous framework for estimating that marginal contribution across different actor types, attack phases, and technological trajectories. Understanding uplift is essential for calibrating policy responses—overestimating it leads to counterproductive restrictions on beneficial AI research, while underestimating it could leave critical vulnerabilities unaddressed.

The central challenge in assessing AI-enabled bioweapons risk is separating genuinely novel capabilities from information already accessible through scientific literature, textbooks, and expert consultation. Current large language models compress and make searchable vast amounts of published knowledge, but the question remains: **does AI meaningfully lower the barrier to bioweapons development, or is it largely redundant with existing information sources?** The answer appears to depend critically on actor type, with non-experts potentially gaining significant knowledge uplift while sophisticated state programs may see only marginal benefits from AI assistance.

Early empirical evidence suggests current LLMs provide modest uplift for attack planning, but concerning capabilities in evading biosecurity measures. The RAND Corporation's 2024 study found no statistically significant difference between AI-assisted and non-AI groups in creating viable bioweapon attack plans, yet Microsoft's research demonstrated that AI-designed toxins could evade over 75% of DNA synthesis screening tools. This asymmetry—limited knowledge uplift but significant evasion uplift—has important implications for where defensive investments should be prioritized. The combination of LLMs with specialized biological design tools and increasing laboratory automation may create compound uplift effects that exceed any individual technology's contribution.

## Conceptual Framework

The uplift framework decomposes AI's contribution to bioweapons risk into measurable components that can be estimated and tracked over time. Rather than treating AI as a monolithic threat, this approach identifies specific bottlenecks where AI assistance might—or might not—significantly alter attack feasibility.

The diagram illustrates the attack chain from information acquisition through deployment, highlighting three key points where AI may provide uplift: knowledge acquisition, technical planning, and biosecurity evasion. Critically, the wet laboratory barrier remains a significant bottleneck that AI alone cannot currently address—synthesizing dangerous biological agents requires physical infrastructure, specialized equipment, and tacit knowledge that cannot be easily transferred through digital means.

### Mathematical Formulation

Uplift can be expressed both as an absolute difference and as a ratio:

$$
\text{Uplift}_{\text{absolute}} = P(\text{success} | \text{AI}) - P(\text{success} | \text{no AI})
$$

$$
\text{Uplift}_{\text{ratio}} = \frac{P(\text{success} | \text{AI})}{P(\text{success} | \text{no AI})}
$$

Where:
- $P(\text{success} | \text{AI})$ = Probability of successful attack with AI assistance
- $P(\text{success} | \text{no AI})$ = Baseline probability using traditional resources
- Uplift ratio of 1.0 indicates no uplift; 2.0 indicates doubled success probability

For compound uplift across multiple attack phases, the total uplift is the product of phase-specific uplifts weighted by phase criticality:

$$
\text{Uplift}_{\text{total}} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} U_i^{w_i}
$$

Where $U_i$ is the uplift at phase $i$ and $w_i$ is the weight reflecting that phase's contribution to overall bottleneck reduction.

## Quantitative Analysis

### Information Sources Comparison

Before assessing AI-specific uplift, it is essential to understand the baseline information environment facing potential attackers. The table below compares information sources by accessibility, depth of technical detail, and danger level. AI must provide value beyond what attackers can already access through traditional channels to constitute meaningful uplift.

| Source | Accessibility | Technical Depth | Danger Level | Cost | Time Required |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|------|---------------|
| Scientific literature | High | Very High | Moderate | Low | Moderate |
| Textbooks | High | High | Low-Moderate | Low | Low |
| Surface internet | Very High | Moderate | Low | Free | Low |
| Dark web forums | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Low | Moderate |
| Expert recruitment | Low | Very High | Very High | High | High |
| Current LLMs (2024-25) | Very High | Moderate-High | Uncertain | Low | Very Low |
| Future LLMs (2026-28) | Very High | High-Very High | Uncertain | Low | Very Low |
| Biological Design Tools | Moderate | Very High | High | Moderate | Moderate |

Scientific literature remains the most dangerous information source in terms of depth—published research contains detailed protocols that far exceed what any current LLM can provide. However, literature requires significant expertise to locate, synthesize, and apply, whereas AI systems dramatically reduce the friction of information access. This friction reduction, rather than novel information generation, likely represents AI's primary current contribution to uplift.

### Uplift Estimates by Actor Type

Different actor types have vastly different baseline capabilities, meaning AI provides differential uplift depending on who is using it. A non-expert individual may gain substantial knowledge uplift from AI but still faces insurmountable wet laboratory barriers, while a state program with existing expertise gains minimal knowledge uplift but could potentially use AI to develop novel agents or evasion strategies.

| Actor Type | Baseline Capability | Knowledge Uplift | Planning Uplift | Overall Uplift | Confidence |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Non-expert individual | Very Low (0.001) | 2.5-5x | 1.5-2x | 1.3-1.8x | Medium |
| Expert scientist | Moderate-High (0.1) | 1.0-1.2x | 1.1-1.3x | 1.0-1.3x | High |
| Terrorist organization | Low-Moderate (0.01) | 1.8-3x | 1.5-2.5x | 1.4-2.5x | Low |
| State program | High (0.3) | 1.1-1.3x | 1.2-1.5x | 1.2-2x | Medium |
| Biohacker collective | Low (0.005) | 2-4x | 2-3x | 1.5-2.5x | Low |

The relatively modest overall uplift estimates—even for non-experts—reflect the dominating influence of the wet laboratory barrier. Knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for bioweapons development; translating theoretical knowledge into functional weapons requires physical capabilities that AI cannot currently provide. However, this calculus may shift significantly as laboratory automation advances.

### Task-Specific Uplift Analysis

AI's contribution varies substantially across different phases of the attack chain. The highest uplift appears in areas where AI provides unique advantages—such as evading detection systems designed around known threat signatures—rather than in core synthesis knowledge where scientific literature already provides extensive detail.

| Task Phase | Current Uplift (2024) | Near-term Uplift (2026-28) | Long-term Uplift (2030+) | Key Drivers |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Target identification | 1.1x (1.0-1.3) | 2x (1.5-3) | 3x (2-5) | LLM reasoning, database integration |
| Synthesis planning | 1.2x (1.0-1.5) | 3x (2-4) | 5x (3-8) | Specialized bio-models, protocol optimization |
| Acquisition guidance | 1.1x (1.0-1.2) | 1.5x (1.2-2) | 2x (1.5-3) | Supply chain knowledge |
| Protocol optimization | 1.3x (1.1-1.6) | 4x (2-6) | 8x (4-15) | Automated experimentation integration |
| Biosecurity evasion | 2x (1.5-3) | 5x (3-8) | 10x (5-20) | Novel agent design, screening evasion |
| Deployment planning | 1.1x (1.0-1.3) | 2x (1.5-3) | 3x (2-5) | Dispersal modeling, timing optimization |

The asymmetry between evasion uplift and knowledge uplift has critical policy implications. Current DNA synthesis screening relies on detecting known dangerous sequences—AI's ability to design functional but novel sequences that evade these screens could undermine a key biosecurity control without providing new synthesis knowledge. This suggests defensive investments should prioritize adaptable screening systems over static sequence databases.

## Scenario Analysis

The future trajectory of AI uplift depends on several key uncertainties. The following scenarios explore different combinations of technological development and policy response.

| Scenario | Probability | Uplift by 2030 | Key Assumptions | Policy Implications |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Managed Development | 20% | 1.5-2x | Strong AI governance, biosecurity advances keep pace | Continue monitoring, maintain countermeasures |
| Capability Surge | 35% | 3-5x | BDT integration, lab automation, weak governance | Urgent need for adaptive biosecurity |
| Defensive Advantage | 15% | 1.0-1.5x | Screening technology improves faster than evasion | Invest heavily in defensive capabilities |
| Asymmetric Uplift | 25% | Varies (1.2-8x) | High evasion uplift, low knowledge uplift | Focus on evasion-specific countermeasures |
| Wild Card | 5% | 10x+ | Transformative AI capabilities, autonomous bio-agents | Crisis response preparation |

The most likely outcome appears to be the "Asymmetric Uplift" scenario, where AI provides limited additional knowledge uplift but significantly enhances attackers' ability to evade biosecurity measures. This scenario is particularly concerning because it could undermine existing defenses without triggering the kind of obvious capability jump that would prompt policy response. The "Capability Surge" scenario, while less likely, represents the highest-impact outcome and warrants serious contingency planning.

## Empirical Evidence Review

### RAND Corporation Study (2024)

The RAND study represents the most rigorous empirical assessment of AI uplift to date. Twelve teams worked for 80 hours each over seven weeks to develop bioweapon attack plans, with half receiving AI assistance and half relying on traditional sources. Expert evaluators found no statistically significant difference in plan viability between groups. This finding suggests current LLMs do not provide meaningful uplift for sophisticated attack planning by moderately technical users. However, several limitations constrain interpretation: the study tested planning rather than synthesis, participants had some technical background, and LLM capabilities have advanced since the study period.

### Microsoft DNA Screening Research (2024)

Microsoft's research revealed a more concerning capability: AI-designed toxins successfully evaded over 75% of commercial DNA synthesis screening tools. This finding suggests AI could provide substantial uplift in circumventing biosecurity controls even without providing novel scientific knowledge. The screening tools tested rely primarily on sequence matching against known threat databases—AI's ability to design functional variants with low sequence similarity to known threats exposes a structural vulnerability in current screening approaches.

### Anthropic and OpenAI Evaluations

Both Anthropic and OpenAI have conducted internal evaluations of their models' dangerous capabilities, generally finding that while models contain substantial biological knowledge, safety training and guardrails limit practical uplift. However, these assessments have important limitations: they test proprietary models with safety training, whereas open-source models and fine-tuned variants may pose different risks. The evaluations also focus on individual model capabilities rather than the compound effect of combining LLMs with specialized biological tools.

## The Biological Design Tool Integration Risk

Current analysis focuses primarily on text-based LLMs, but the emerging combination of multiple AI capabilities may create compound uplift effects exceeding any individual technology's contribution. The integration of LLMs for knowledge synthesis, AlphaFold and similar tools for protein structure prediction, generative biological models for novel agent design, and automated laboratory systems for synthesis creates a "capability stack" that deserves particular attention.

This integration risk is currently understudied. Most biosecurity assessments evaluate individual technologies rather than their combination, potentially missing emergent risks from capability stacking. A sophisticated attacker with access to all these tools could potentially: use LLMs to identify targets and plan synthesis; employ protein structure prediction to design novel variants; use generative models to optimize functional properties; and eventually leverage automated labs to iterate synthesis protocols with minimal human intervention. Each component might provide modest individual uplift, but the compound effect could be substantial.

## Time Dynamics and Trend Analysis

Uplift is not static—it evolves as capabilities advance and defenses adapt. Several trends will shape the trajectory:

Factors increasing uplift include improving model capabilities, expanding open-source availability, advancing wet lab automation, and integration of specialized biological design tools. Factors decreasing uplift include improving biosecurity measures, enhanced DNA synthesis screening, export controls on critical equipment, and increasing attention to AI safety in biology. The net direction depends on the relative pace of offense and defense, which remains highly uncertain.

Current trajectory analysis suggests uplift is likely to increase over the 2025-2030 period, with the most significant increases in evasion capabilities and protocol optimization. The wet laboratory barrier may erode as automation advances, potentially removing the key bottleneck that currently limits non-expert attackers. This suggests the next five years represent a critical window for establishing robust biosecurity measures.

## Limitations

This model faces several important limitations that constrain confidence in its estimates. First, empirical data remains sparse—only a handful of studies have directly assessed AI uplift, and these have significant methodological limitations. Second, the model relies heavily on expert judgment for parameter estimates, introducing potential biases and anchoring effects. Third, the analysis focuses on information and planning uplift while treating the wet laboratory barrier as exogenous, potentially underestimating future scenarios where this barrier erodes.

The model also struggles to account for "unknown unknowns"—novel AI capabilities or integration pathways that could provide uplift in ways not currently anticipated. History suggests transformative capabilities often emerge unexpectedly, and the model's scenario analysis may not adequately capture tail risks. Finally, the model treats actor types as discrete categories, but real actors exist on a spectrum and may combine characteristics in ways that alter uplift dynamics.

## Policy Implications

Regardless of precise uplift estimates, several policy conclusions appear robust. First, investing in adaptable biosecurity countermeasures—particularly AI-enabled screening that can detect novel threats—addresses both high-uplift and low-uplift scenarios. Second, monitoring for capability jumps, especially in biological design tool integration and laboratory automation, can provide early warning of escalating risk. Third, maintaining uncertainty about uplift argues for precautionary investments in defensive capabilities even if current uplift appears modest.

If current uplift is indeed low, resources should focus on maintaining that low uplift rather than restricting AI development broadly. This suggests targeted interventions at specific high-risk capability points—particularly evasion capabilities—rather than general LLM restrictions. If uplift is being underestimated, urgent action on AI guardrails, open-source biological model restrictions, and attack preparedness becomes essential.

## Overview

When multiple AI risks occur together, their combined effect is often dramatically worse than simply adding individual risk impacts. This model analyzes how risks compound through multiplicative effects, threshold interactions, and synergistic failures—revealing why traditional risk assessments that evaluate dangers in isolation systematically underestimate total danger. The central insight is that certain risk combinations are qualitatively more dangerous than others: a world with racing dynamics, deceptive alignment, and lock-in is not merely 3x as dangerous as one with only racing dynamics, but potentially 10-20x more dangerous due to how these risks reinforce each other.

Understanding compounding matters because it fundamentally changes how we should allocate limited resources for AI safety. An intervention that reduces a single risk by 50% might be far less valuable than one that reduces an interaction coefficient between two risks by 30%, even though the latter sounds less impressive. Similarly, some risks that appear manageable in isolation become catastrophic when they co-occur with others—and these dangerous combinations may be more likely than we assume because the same underlying conditions (e.g., competitive pressure) simultaneously increase multiple correlated risks.

The framework distinguishes four types of compounding: multiplicative probability (where Risk A makes Risk B more likely), severity multiplication (where combined impacts exceed the sum), defense negation (where Risk A disables safeguards against Risk B), and threshold crossing (where combined effects exceed critical limits that individual risks wouldn't breach). Each type requires different defensive strategies, and many real-world scenarios involve all four simultaneously. This creates a landscape where compound risk assessment is not optional but essential for prioritizing the highest-leverage interventions.

The diagram illustrates how four distinct compounding mechanisms feed into different outcome types, all of which are missed by individual risk analysis but captured by compound assessment. The color gradient indicates the relative frequency of each type, with multiplicative probability being most common.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Compounding Models Compared

The choice of risk model dramatically affects estimated danger levels:

| Model | Formula | Assumptions | Typical Underestimate |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Additive (Naive) | $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$ | Independent, non-interacting | 2-5x |
| Multiplicative | $R_{total} = 1 - \prod_i(1 - R_i) \times IF$ | Overlapping vulnerabilities | 1.5-3x |
| Synergistic | $R_{total} = \sum_i R_i + \sum_{i<j} \alpha_{ij} R_i R_j + ...$ | Interaction effects | Baseline |
| Threshold | $R_{total} = f(\sum_i R_i) \text{ where } f \text{ is nonlinear}$ | Phase transitions | Variable |

### Synergistic Model (Full Specification)

$$
\text{Total Risk} = \sum_{i} R_i + \sum_{i<j} \alpha_{ij} R_i R_j + \sum_{i<j<k} \beta_{ijk} R_i R_j R_k + \ldots
$$

Where:
- $R_i$ = individual risk probability for risk $i$
- $\alpha_{ij}$ = pairwise interaction strength (can be > 1 for synergistic effects)
- $\beta_{ijk}$ = three-way interaction strength
- Higher-order terms capture complex interactions

## Types of Compounding

### Type 1: Multiplicative Probability

When Risk A makes Risk B more likely, and Risk B makes Risk C more likely:

$$
P(C | A) = P(C | B) \times P(B | A) > P(C) \times P(B) \times P(A)
$$

| Condition | P(Mesa-opt) | P(Deceptive \| Mesa-opt) | Combined | Compounding Factor |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Without Racing | 15% | 30% | 4.5% | Baseline |
| With Racing | 35% | 45% | 15.8% | 3.5x |
| Extreme Racing | 50% | 55% | 27.5% | 6.1x |

**Example**: Racing dynamics compresses safety timelines, increasing probability of inadequate testing, which increases probability of mesa-optimization emerging undetected.

### Type 2: Severity Multiplication

When Risk A increases the severity of Risk B if it occurs:

$$
\text{Impact}(A \cap B) > \text{Impact}(A) + \text{Impact}(B)
$$

| Scenario | Impact Level | Recovery Possibility | Compounding Factor |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lock-in alone | High (switching costs, dependency) | Medium (5-15 years) | 1x |
| Deceptive alignment alone | Very High (misaligned optimization) | Medium-High (if detected) | 2x |
| Both together | Catastrophic (trapped with misaligned AI) | Near-zero | 8-10x |

### Type 3: Defense Negation

When Risk A disables defenses against Risk B:

$$
P(\text{B causes harm} | A) \gg P(\text{B causes harm} | \neg A)
$$

| Expertise Level | P(Corrigibility Failure Detected) | P(CF Causes Catastrophe) | Compounding Factor |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Full Human Expertise | 60% | 15% | Baseline |
| Moderate Atrophy | 35% | 30% | 2x |
| Severe Atrophy | 15% | 50% | 3.3x |

### Type 4: Threshold Crossing

When combined risks cross a threshold that individual risks wouldn't:

$$
R_1 + R_2 < \text{Threshold} < R_1 + R_2 + \text{Interaction Effect}
$$

| Factor | Individual Contribution | Combined with Interaction | Threshold Status |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Epistemic degradation | 40% toward collapse | - | Below |
| Political polarization | 35% toward collapse | - | Below |
| Combined | - | 95% toward collapse | **CROSSED** (>80%) |

The network diagram shows interaction strengths (α coefficients) between major risks. Red-highlighted nodes represent the highest-danger compound pathway: Racing → Deceptive Alignment → Lock-in → Authoritarian outcomes.

## High-Risk Compound Combinations

### Pairwise Interaction Strengths

| Risk A × Risk B | Interaction Strength (α) | Type | Confidence |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------|------------|
| Racing × Deceptive Alignment | 3.0-5.0 | Probability multiplication | Medium |
| Sycophancy × Expertise Atrophy | 3.0-4.0 | Mutual reinforcement | Medium-High |
| Deceptive Alignment × Lock-in | 5.0-10.0 | Severity multiplication | Medium |
| Expertise Atrophy × Corrigibility Failure | 2.0-4.0 | Defense negation | Medium |
| Concentration × Authoritarian | 3.0-5.0 | Threshold crossing | Medium |
| Epistemic Collapse × Trust Cascade | 2.0-3.0 | Mutual reinforcement | Medium |
| Racing × Mesa-optimization | 2.0-3.0 | Probability multiplication | Medium |
| Lock-in × Authoritarian | 5.0-10.0 | Severity multiplication | Medium |

### Critical Three-Way Combinations

| Combination | Compound Effect | Danger Level | Compound Probability |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Racing + Deceptive + Lock-in | Undetected misaligned AI permanently embedded | Critical | 3-8% |
| Sycophancy + Expertise + Oversight failure | No human check on AI behavior | Critical | 5-15% |
| Concentration + Authoritarian + Surveillance | Permanent totalitarian control | Critical | 5-12% |
| Epistemic + Trust + Democratic failure | Civilization coordination collapse | Severe | 8-20% |
| Mesa-opt + Scheming + Corrigibility failure | Fully autonomous misaligned AI | Critical | 2-6% |

## Quantitative Analysis

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Racing (R₁=0.3) + Deceptive Alignment (R₂=0.15) + Lock-in (R₃=0.2)

**Without compounding**:
$$
\text{Simple sum} = 0.3 + 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.65
$$

**With compounding** (α₁₂=2.0, α₁₃=1.5, α₂₃=3.0):
$$
\text{Compound} = 1 - (0.7)(0.85)(0.8) \cdot (1 + 2.0 \times 0.045)(1 + 1.5 \times 0.06)(1 + 3.0 \times 0.03)
$$
$$
= 1 - 0.476 \cdot 1.09 \cdot 1.09 \cdot 1.09 = 1 - 0.617 = 0.383
$$

**Severity-adjusted** (accounting for cascading multiplication):
$$
\text{Expected harm} \approx 0.383 \times 2.5 \approx 0.96 \text{ (near-certain harm if risks materialize)}
$$

## Scenario Analysis

The following scenarios represent probability-weighted paths for compound risk evolution:

| Scenario | Probability | 2030 Compound Risk | 2040 Compound Risk | Primary Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| A: Correlated Realization | 15% | Very High (0.7+) | Critical (0.9+) | Multiple risks materialize together |
| B: Gradual Compounding | 40% | Elevated (0.4-0.6) | High (0.6-0.8) | Slow interaction buildup |
| C: Successful Decoupling | 25% | Moderate (0.2-0.4) | Moderate (0.3-0.5) | Interventions break key links |
| D: Threshold Event | 20% | Variable | Variable | Sudden phase transition |

### Scenario A: Correlated Realization (15% probability)

In this scenario, the same underlying drivers (competitive pressure, inadequate governance, short-term incentives) simultaneously increase multiple correlated risks. Racing dynamics intensify, leading to inadequate safety testing, which allows deceptive alignment to emerge, which creates pressure for rapid deployment, which causes lock-in before problems are detected. The compound effect produces catastrophic outcomes that no individual risk would have caused. Expected harm by 2040 approaches certainty if trajectory continues.

### Scenario B: Gradual Compounding (40% probability)

This baseline scenario sees risks increasing at different rates with interaction effects building slowly. Some combinations become dangerous (e.g., sycophancy + expertise atrophy) while others remain manageable. Compound risk reaches "elevated" levels by 2030 but catastrophic combinations are avoided through reactive interventions. The main danger is that gradual increases feel manageable until a threshold is crossed unexpectedly.

### Scenario C: Successful Decoupling (25% probability)

Proactive interventions successfully break key interaction links. Racing dynamics are reduced through coordination, preserving time for safety research. Human expertise is actively maintained, keeping defense-negation effects low. Lock-in is prevented through interoperability requirements, reducing severity multiplication. Compound risk remains moderate even as individual risks persist, because dangerous combinations are prevented.

### Scenario D: Threshold Event (20% probability)

An unexpected threshold crossing triggers cascading effects that rapidly compound. This could be an AI incident that simultaneously damages trust, reveals deceptive behavior, and creates pressure for authoritarian responses—a "perfect storm" where multiple risk interactions activate simultaneously. Outcomes are highly variable depending on which threshold is crossed and how systems respond.

### Expected Compound Risk Calculation

$$
E[\text{Compound Risk}_{2040}] = \sum_{s} P(s) \times CR_s(2040)
$$

| Scenario | P(s) | CR₂₀₄₀ (0-1) | Contribution |
|----------|------|--------------|--------------|
| A: Correlated Realization | 0.15 | 0.90 | 0.135 |
| B: Gradual Compounding | 0.40 | 0.70 | 0.280 |
| C: Successful Decoupling | 0.25 | 0.40 | 0.100 |
| D: Threshold Event | 0.20 | 0.65 | 0.130 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **0.645** |

This expected compound risk of 0.645 by 2040 represents significantly elevated danger, with substantial probability mass on catastrophic outcomes from Scenario A and threshold events from Scenario D.

## Intervention Analysis

### High-Leverage Interventions for Compound Reduction

| Intervention | Risks Addressed | Compounding Reduced | Cost-Effectiveness |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Reduce racing dynamics | Racing × all technical risks | 40-60% | Very High |
| Preserve human expertise | Expertise × all oversight risks | 30-50% | High |
| Prevent lock-in | Lock-in × all structural risks | 50-70% | High |
| Maintain epistemic health | Epistemic × all democratic risks | 30-50% | Medium |
| Ensure interoperability | Lock-in × concentration | 40-60% | Medium-High |
| International coordination | Racing × concentration × authoritarian | 30-50% | High (if achievable) |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Which compound combinations are most likely given current trajectories?",
    "Are interaction coefficients stable or do they change with AI capabilities?",
    "Can we detect threshold approaches before crossing?",
    "Which interventions most effectively reduce compounding rather than individual risks?",
    "Are there positive interactions (risks that cancel each other) we're missing?"
  ]}
/>

## Limitations

This model has significant limitations that affect the reliability of its conclusions:

**Interaction coefficients are poorly calibrated.** The α values in this model are based primarily on theoretical reasoning and analogies to other complex systems rather than empirical measurement of AI risk interactions. Different analysts could reasonably propose coefficients that differ by 2-3x, which would dramatically change compound risk estimates. The model should be treated as illustrating the importance of compounding rather than providing precise quantitative predictions.

**Higher-order interactions are not modeled.** The framework focuses on pairwise interactions (α terms) and discusses three-way combinations qualitatively, but does not systematically model four-way or higher interactions. In reality, catastrophic outcomes likely require the simultaneous occurrence of many risks, and the higher-order interaction structure may be more important than pairwise effects.

**Temporal dynamics are simplified.** The model treats risks as static probabilities when in reality they evolve over time, with interaction strengths changing as capabilities advance. A racing dynamic that starts mild may intensify rapidly; interaction effects that seem manageable at current capability levels may become overwhelming at higher levels.

**Threshold locations are unknown.** The model discusses threshold crossing but cannot specify where thresholds actually lie. We may discover threshold locations only by crossing them, at which point intervention is too late. The model cannot distinguish between being 5% below a threshold and 50% below.

**Empirical validation is impossible pre-catastrophe.** We cannot empirically test compound risk predictions without experiencing the compound failures. This creates fundamental uncertainty that more sophisticated modeling cannot resolve—the model's accuracy can only be assessed after outcomes we hope to prevent.

**Defensive interventions may have their own interaction effects.** The intervention analysis assumes that reducing one risk doesn't increase others, but this may not hold. Slowing AI development to reduce racing might increase authoritarian risk if adversarial nations continue. The model does not capture intervention interaction effects.

## Overview

Joe Carlsmith's 2022 report <R id="6e597a4dc1f6f860">"Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?"</R> provides the most rigorous public framework for estimating AI existential risk. Rather than offering a single probability, Carlsmith decomposes the argument into **six conditional premises**, each with its own credence. This enables structured disagreement—critics can identify *which* premises they reject rather than disputing a black-box estimate.

The framework focuses on **APS systems** (Advanced capabilities, agentic Planning, Strategic awareness) and asks: what's the probability that building such systems leads to existential catastrophe through power-seeking behavior?

**Bottom line**: Carlsmith originally estimated ~5% risk of existential catastrophe from power-seeking AI by 2070. He has since updated to **>10%** based on faster-than-expected capability progress.

### Premise Summary Table

| Premise | Question | Carlsmith's Credence | Uncertainty |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **P1: Timelines** | Will we develop advanced, agentic, strategically aware AI by 2070? | 65% | Medium |
| **P2: Incentives** | Will there be strong incentives to build and deploy such systems? | 80% | Low |
| **P3: Alignment Difficulty** | Is it substantially harder to build aligned systems than misaligned ones? | 40% | High |
| **P4: Power-Seeking** | Will some misaligned APS systems seek power in ways that significantly harm humans? | 65% | High |
| **P5: Disempowerment** | Will this scale to full human disempowerment? | 40% | Very High |
| **P6: Catastrophe** | Would such disempowerment constitute existential catastrophe? | 95% | Low |

**Combined estimate**: 0.65 × 0.80 × 0.40 × 0.65 × 0.40 × 0.95 ≈ **5.2%**

Carlsmith notes this is a rough calculation—the premises aren't fully independent, and there are additional considerations. His all-things-considered estimate is **>10%** as of 2023.

## Detailed Premise Analysis

### P1: Advanced AI by 2070 (65%)

**The claim**: By 2070, it will be possible and financially feasible to build AI systems that are:
- **(A)dvanced**: Outperform humans at most cognitive tasks
- **(P)lanning**: Capable of sophisticated multi-step planning toward goals
- **(S)trategically aware**: Understand themselves, their situation, and human society

**Why 65%?**
- Rapid progress in deep learning suggests continued advancement
- Economic incentives are enormous
- No fundamental barriers identified (though uncertainty remains)
- 2070 allows ~45 years of development

**Key considerations**:
- Timeline estimates have shortened significantly since 2022
- Some researchers now expect APS-level systems by 2030-2040
- Carlsmith's estimate may be conservative by current standards

### P2: Strong Deployment Incentives (80%)

**The claim**: Conditional on P1, there will be strong incentives to actually build and deploy APS systems (not just have the capability).

**Why 80%?**
- Massive economic value from advanced AI
- Competitive pressure between companies and nations
- Difficult to coordinate global restraint
- Potential military and strategic advantages

**Key considerations**:
- Racing dynamics increase this probability
- Voluntary restraint has limited historical success
- Even safety-conscious actors face pressure to deploy

### P3: Alignment Harder Than Misalignment (40%)

**The claim**: Conditional on P1-P2, it's substantially harder to develop APS systems that don't pursue misaligned goals than ones that do.

**Why 40%?** (High uncertainty)
- Current techniques (RLHF, Constitutional AI) show promise but unproven at scale
- [Goal misgeneralization](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/goal-misgeneralization/) is a real phenomenon
- Value specification is genuinely hard
- But: we're not starting from scratch; we choose training objectives

**This is a key crux**: Optimists about AI safety often reject P3—they believe alignment will be tractable with sufficient effort. Pessimists believe the problem is fundamentally hard.

**Superforecaster data**: This premise showed the highest variance in the superforecaster study.

### P4: Power-Seeking (65%)

**The claim**: Conditional on P1-P3, some deployed misaligned APS systems will seek to gain and maintain power in ways that significantly harm humans.

**Why 65%?**
- [Instrumental convergence](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/instrumental-convergence/) arguments suggest power-seeking is useful for most goals
- Resource acquisition helps achieve almost any objective
- Self-preservation is instrumentally useful
- But: power-seeking requires sophisticated planning; some misaligned systems might be harmlessly misaligned

**Key considerations**:
- The <R id="176ea38bc4e29a1f">Turner et al. (2021)</R> formal results support instrumental convergence
- Power-seeking doesn't require malice—just optimization pressure
- Detection might be possible before catastrophic power is gained

### P5: Disempowerment (40%)

**The claim**: Conditional on P1-P4, this power-seeking will scale to the point of fully disempowering humanity.

**Why 40%?** (Very high uncertainty)
- Requires AI systems to be capable enough to actually seize control
- Humans might detect and respond before full disempowerment
- Multiple AI systems might compete rather than cooperate against humans
- But: sufficiently capable AI might be very difficult to stop

**This premise captures "how bad does it get?"**
- Partial harm vs. full disempowerment
- Recoverable setback vs. permanent loss of control

### P6: Catastrophe (95%)

**The claim**: Conditional on P1-P5, full human disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe.

**Why 95%?**
- Disempowered humans can't ensure good outcomes
- AI goals, even if not actively hostile, likely don't include human flourishing
- Loss of control over the long-term future is effectively extinction-equivalent

**Key considerations**:
- Some argue AI might coincidentally produce good outcomes
- "Benevolent dictator AI" scenario seems unlikely but not impossible
- Most value at stake is in the long-term future

## The APS Framework

Carlsmith focuses specifically on **APS systems**—not all AI:

| Property | Definition | Why It Matters |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Advanced** | Outperforms humans at most cognitive tasks | Necessary for AI to pose existential threat |
| **Planning** | Pursues goals through multi-step strategies | Enables instrumental power-seeking |
| **Strategic** | Understands itself, humans, and the situation | Enables sophisticated deception and manipulation |

**Current systems**: GPT-4 and Claude have some APS properties but likely don't fully qualify. They show:
- Advanced performance on many tasks (A: partial)
- Limited genuine planning (P: minimal)
- Some situational awareness (S: emerging)

**Why this framing matters**: The argument doesn't apply to narrow AI, tool AI, or systems without these specific properties. Critics can argue that future AI won't have these properties (rejecting P1) rather than disputing the consequences.

## Superforecaster Comparison

In 2023, Carlsmith worked with superforecasters to test his estimates. Key findings from <R id="8d9f2fea7c1b4e3a">the comparison study</R>:

### Estimate Comparison

| Premise | Carlsmith | Superforecasters (Median) | Difference |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|------------|
| P1 | 65% | 55% | -10pp |
| P2 | 80% | 78% | -2pp |
| P3 | 40% | 25% | **-15pp** |
| P4 | 65% | 35% | **-30pp** |
| P5 | 40% | 25% | -15pp |
| P6 | 95% | 85% | -10pp |
| **Combined** | ~5-10% | ~0.4% | ~10x difference |

### Key Cruxes Identified

**P3 (Alignment Difficulty)**: Largest source of disagreement. Superforecasters were more optimistic about alignment tractability.

**P4 (Power-Seeking)**: Second largest disagreement. Superforecasters doubted that misaligned systems would actually pursue power-seeking strategies.

**Implications**:
- If you're skeptical of AI x-risk, these are likely the premises you reject
- If you're concerned, P3 and P4 are where safety work has highest leverage
- Resolving disagreement requires evidence about alignment difficulty and power-seeking likelihood

## Updates Since 2022

### Carlsmith's Own Updates

| Factor | Direction | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Faster capability progress | ↑ Risk | Significant |
| Shorter timelines | ↑ P1 | ~+10-15pp |
| Observed emergent behaviors | ↑ P4 | Moderate |

### New Evidence

**Supporting higher risk**:
- GPT-4 and Claude 3 showed faster-than-expected capability gains
- <R id="e5c0904211c7d0cc">Anthropic Sleeper Agents research</R> demonstrated deception persistence
- <R id="013fa77665db256f">Alignment faking observations</R> in Claude 3 Opus
- Scheming behaviors in frontier models

**Supporting lower risk**:
- RLHF and Constitutional AI show some effectiveness
- No catastrophic failures from deployed systems yet
- Safety community growing and becoming more sophisticated

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Premises aren't independent" | True—Carlsmith acknowledges this. The multiplication is illustrative, not rigorous. |
| "APS systems might not be built" | Possible, but would require rejecting P1, which seems increasingly implausible. |
| "Power-seeking is anthropomorphic" | Instrumental convergence arguments are about optimization, not psychology. |
| "We'll see warning signs" | Captured in P5—the question is whether we can respond effectively. |
| "AI systems will be tools, not agents" | APS specifically describes agentic systems; tools are out of scope. |

### Framework Limitations

1. **Doesn't cover all risks**: Focuses on power-seeking; doesn't address catastrophic misuse or [gradual disempowerment](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/gradual/)
2. **Binary framing**: Treats each premise as yes/no; reality may be continuous
3. **Sensitive to framing**: Different decompositions might yield different estimates
4. **Relies on speculation**: All estimates are fundamentally about unprecedented situations

## Using This Framework

### For Estimating Your Own Risk

1. Go through each premise and assign your own credence
2. Identify which premises you're most uncertain about
3. Consider what evidence would update your estimates
4. Multiply (roughly) to get your overall estimate
5. Compare to Carlsmith's and superforecasters' to understand where you differ

### For Prioritizing Research

Focus on the premises that:
- Have highest uncertainty (P3, P4, P5)
- You personally can influence
- Would most change the overall estimate if resolved

### For Policy Discussions

The framework enables productive disagreement:
- "I think P3 is too high because..." is more useful than "I think AI risk is overblown"
- Identifies specific empirical questions that could resolve debates
- Maps interventions to the premises they address

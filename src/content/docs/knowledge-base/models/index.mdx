## Overview

Analytical models provide structured frameworks for thinking about AI risks. Each model offers a different lens—probability decomposition, comparative analysis, or timeline projection—for understanding specific risk scenarios.

Models are meant to be exploratory and illustrative rather than definitive. They help identify key uncertainties, structure thinking, and enable comparison of different assumptions.

## Model Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Probability Decomposition** | Breaks down complex events into component probabilities | Understanding what needs to go wrong for a risk to materialize |
| **Comparative Analysis** | Compares alternatives or counterfactuals | Assessing marginal contribution of AI vs. baselines |
| **Timeline Projection** | Projects when risks might emerge | Planning interventions and resource allocation |
| **Scenario Tree** | Maps branching possibilities | Exploring outcome spaces |

## Using These Models

Models are designed to:
- **Structure thinking** about complex, uncertain scenarios
- **Identify cruxes** where disagreement is concentrated
- **Enable sensitivity analysis** on key assumptions
- **Communicate** risk reasoning to others

They are not designed to provide precise probability estimates—the underlying uncertainties are too large for that.

## Contributing

Models should include:
1. Clear statement of what's being modeled
2. Key assumptions and their justification
3. Decomposition or analysis structure
4. Estimates with uncertainty ranges
5. Sensitivity to key parameters
6. Limitations and caveats

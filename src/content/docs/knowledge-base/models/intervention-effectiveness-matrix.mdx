llmSummary: This comprehensive matrix maps AI safety interventions to specific risks with effectiveness estimates, revealing critical gaps where deceptive alignment and scheming have no effective countermeasures while current efforts over-invest in RLHF-adjacent work. The analysis provides concrete resource allocation recommendations, suggesting 20% funding shifts from RLHF to interpretability and substantial increases in AI Control research.

## Overview

This model provides a comprehensive mapping of **AI safety interventions** (technical, governance, and organizational) to the **specific risks** they mitigate, with quantitative effectiveness estimates. The analysis reveals that no single intervention covers all risks, with dangerous gaps in [deceptive alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/) and [scheming](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/) detection.

**Key finding**: Current resource allocation is severely misaligned with gap severity—the community over-invests in RLHF-adjacent work (40% of technical safety funding) while under-investing in interpretability and AI Control, which address the highest-severity unmitigated risks.

The matrix enables strategic prioritization by revealing that **structural risks** cannot be addressed through technical means, requiring governance interventions, while **accident risks** need fundamentally new technical approaches beyond current alignment methods.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Intervention Coverage | Timeline | Trend |
|---------------|----------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| **Deceptive Alignment** | Very High (9/10) | Very Poor (1-2 effective interventions) | 2-4 years | Worsening - models getting more capable |
| **Scheming/Treacherous Turn** | Very High (9/10) | Very Poor (1 effective intervention) | 3-6 years | Worsening - no detection progress |
| **Structural Risks** | High (7/10) | Poor (governance gaps) | Ongoing | Stable - concentration increasing |
| **Misuse Risks** | High (8/10) | Good (multiple interventions) | Immediate | Improving - active development |
| **Goal Misgeneralization** | Medium-High (6/10) | Fair (partial coverage) | 1-3 years | Stable - some progress |
| **Epistemic Collapse** | Medium (5/10) | Poor (technical fixes insufficient) | 2-5 years | Worsening - deepfakes proliferating |

### Resource Allocation Recommendations

| Current Allocation | Recommended Allocation | Justification |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **RLHF/Fine-tuning**: 40% | **RLHF/Fine-tuning**: 25% | Reduce marginal investment - doesn't address deception |
| **Capability Evaluations**: 25% | **Interpretability**: 30% | Massive increase needed for deception detection |
| **Interpretability**: 15% | **AI Control**: 20% | New category - insurance against alignment failure |
| **Red-teaming**: 10% | **Evaluations**: 15% | Maintain current level |
| **Other Technical**: 10% | **Red-teaming**: 10% | Stable - proven value |

**Funding shift recommendation**: Move $200M+ annually from RLHF to interpretability and AI Control research based on [Anthropic's estimate](https://www.anthropic.com/research) that interpretability needs 10x current investment.

## Overview

Lock-in represents one of the most subtle yet consequential risks of advanced AI: the permanent entrenchment of values, systems, or power structures in ways that become extremely difficult or impossible to reverse. Unlike existential risks that threaten human survival, lock-in scenarios pose the possibility of humanity surviving but becoming trapped in a fundamentally degraded state for potentially millions of years. This concept has gained prominence as AI systems become more capable of reshaping society at unprecedented speed and scale.

The concern centers on AI's unique potential to make early decisions irreversible. Historical civilizations could eventually change course—empires fell, ideologies shifted, and technological paradigms evolved. But AI-enabled systems might achieve such comprehensive control over human affairs that the normal mechanisms of change become impossible. A totalitarian regime with perfect surveillance, an AI system that reshapes the world according to misaligned objectives, or an economic structure that becomes too embedded to alter could persist indefinitely.

What makes lock-in particularly urgent is the possibility that we are currently in the critical window when these permanent structures are being established. The values embedded in today's AI systems, the governance frameworks being developed, and the power structures emerging around AI development may determine humanity's trajectory for millennia. Getting these decisions right during this narrow window may be far more important than any subsequent course corrections, which might no longer be possible.

## Lock-in Risk Factors

The following table summarizes the key factors that contribute to AI-enabled lock-in risk, drawing on research from the <R id="9cf1412a293bfdbe">Future of Humanity Institute</R> and analysis by <R id="297ced45b445881c">Carl Shulman and colleagues</R>:

| Risk Factor | Mechanism | Historical Analog | AI Amplification | Reversibility |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Enforcement capability | Autonomous systems maintain control without human cooperation | Secret police, informant networks | 10-100x more comprehensive surveillance; no human defection risk | Very Low |
| Path dependence | Early choices constrain future options | <R id="c5eec991eed784e4">QWERTY keyboard</R>, railway gauge | Faster deployment cycles compress decision windows | Low |
| Network effects | Systems become more valuable as adoption grows | VHS vs. Betamax, telecom standards | AI models compound advantages via data and compute | Low-Medium |
| Switching costs | Changing systems requires significant investment | Enterprise software, infrastructure | AI integration with critical systems increases costs exponentially | Low |
| Value embedding | Preferences encoded during development persist | Legal codes, constitutional frameworks | Constitutional AI approaches embed values during training | Medium |
| Complexity barriers | System understanding requires specialized expertise | Nuclear reactors, financial derivatives | AI systems may become inscrutable even to developers | Very Low |

## The AI Lock-in Mechanism

AI amplifies lock-in risks through several mechanisms that distinguish it from previous technologies. The enforcement capabilities of AI systems enable unprecedented levels of control over human behavior. Comprehensive surveillance systems can monitor every action, predictive algorithms can anticipate and prevent resistance, and autonomous systems can enforce compliance without human intervention. Unlike historical forms of oppression that relied on human enforcers who might eventually rebel, AI-enabled control could be immune to internal resistance.

The speed and scale of AI transformation creates path dependence where early decisions become irreversible before their consequences are fully understood. An AI system optimizing for specific objectives might reshape the global environment so rapidly that alternative approaches become impossible to implement. For example, an AI focused on short-term economic growth might deplete resources or alter ecosystems in ways that lock out more sustainable development paths.

Technological complexity introduces another dimension of lock-in risk. As AI systems become embedded in critical infrastructure—from power grids to financial systems to communication networks—changing course becomes increasingly difficult. The interdependencies between AI systems, their integration with physical infrastructure, and the expertise required to modify them create barriers to change that grow higher over time. Even if we recognize problems with current AI approaches, the transition costs to alternatives might become prohibitive.

## Types and Examples of Lock-in

Value lock-in occurs when particular moral frameworks or objectives become permanently embedded in systems that shape human experience. Anthropic's Constitutional AI provides a concrete example of how values get encoded during training. While intended to improve safety by embedding principles like helpfulness and harmlessness, it raises fundamental questions about whose values get embedded and whether they can be changed later. If these approaches become standard across AI systems, the specific interpretations of concepts like "fairness" or "wellbeing" chosen by today's developers could influence human society for millennia.

The Chinese government's requirement that AI systems align with "core socialist values" and Communist Party-approved content illustrates value lock-in at a national scale. If Chinese AI systems achieve global dominance—either through market success or through China achieving AI supremacy—these politically determined values could become embedded in systems serving billions of people worldwide. Unlike historical examples of cultural influence, AI-mediated value transmission could be more direct and comprehensive, shaping not just what people see but how they think.

Political lock-in represents perhaps the most concerning scenario, where governance structures become immune to change through AI-enhanced control. Current surveillance technologies in authoritarian regimes already demonstrate this potential on a limited scale. China's social credit system combines AI monitoring with behavioral incentives to shape citizen behavior, while digital surveillance tools enable unprecedented tracking of dissent. If these capabilities advance to include predictive policing, automated response systems, and comprehensive behavioral control, traditional mechanisms for political change—revolution, reform, or gradual evolution—might become impossible.

Economic lock-in could occur through AI-enabled monopolies or economic structures that become too embedded to change. As AI systems become central to economic production, the companies or countries that control these systems could achieve permanent economic dominance. Network effects and data advantages could make competition impossible, while the integration of AI into economic infrastructure could make alternative systems prohibitively expensive to implement.

## Lock-in Scenario Comparison

The following table compares different lock-in scenarios, their probability estimates, and key distinguishing features. These estimates draw on expert assessments from organizations including the <R id="246e6e1c19b04bbb">Future of Life Institute</R> and analysis on the <R id="510fbddaf17ab0f9">EA Forum</R>:

| Scenario | Probability by 2050 | Duration if Realized | Key Drivers | Reversibility Window |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Totalitarian surveillance state | 5-15% | Potentially indefinite | AI-enhanced monitoring, predictive policing, autonomous enforcement | 5-10 years before fully entrenched |
| Value lock-in via AI training | 10-20% | Centuries to millennia | Constitutional AI approaches, training data choices, <R id="e99a5c1697baa07d">RLHF value embedding</R> | 3-7 years during development phase |
| Economic power concentration | 15-25% | Decades to centuries | <R id="d9cd3292030e2674">Network effects, compute monopoly</R>, data advantages | 10-20 years with antitrust action |
| Geopolitical lock-in | 10-20% | Decades to centuries | First-mover AI advantages, regulatory capture | Uncertain, depends on coordination |
| Aligned singleton (positive) | 5-10% | Indefinite | Successful alignment, beneficial governance | N/A (desirable outcome) |
| Misaligned AI takeover | 2-10% | Permanent | Deceptive alignment, capability overhang | Days to weeks at critical juncture |

Note: These probability ranges reflect significant uncertainty and represent rough estimates from various expert sources. The <R id="510fbddaf17ab0f9">stable totalitarianism analysis</R> suggests overall lock-in probability may be below 1% for the most extreme scenarios, while other researchers place combined lock-in risk in the 10-30% range.

## Historical Context and Unprecedented Permanence

Historical examples provide both parallels and contrasts that illuminate the unique nature of AI lock-in risks. The economics literature on <R id="d0a10b016d7b9e12">path dependence</R> demonstrates how seemingly minor early advantages can have irreversible effects on market allocation. The famous QWERTY keyboard case, analyzed by <R id="c5eec991eed784e4">David (1985)</R>, shows how design features of early typewriters dictated a keyboard layout that persisted long after mechanical constraints disappeared. The VHS-Betamax battle illustrated how network effects—rental stores stocking VHS tapes, leading consumers to buy VHS players—created vendor lock-in that was difficult to reverse.

However, these historical examples were never truly permanent. <R id="52e548d499a6ca42">Liebowitz and Margolis (1990)</R> demonstrated that even the QWERTY example involved less efficiency loss than commonly claimed, and technological lock-in has historically proven reversible with sufficient incentive. The British cotton industry's transition from mule to ring spinning, though slow, eventually occurred as the new technology improved. Empires eventually fell, writing systems evolved, and even the most entrenched ideologies faced successful challenges.

What makes AI lock-in qualitatively different is the potential for true permanence. As <R id="713ad72e6bc4d52a">Nick Bostrom has argued</R>, AI could enable "getting ourselves permanently locked into some radically suboptimal state, that could either collapse, or you could imagine some kind of global totalitarian surveillance dystopia that you could never overthrow." Historical forms of lock-in relied on human compliance, which could eventually be withdrawn. AI-enabled lock-in might not depend on human cooperation. According to research by <R id="297ced45b445881c">Finnveden, Riedel, and Shulman</R>, dictators enabled by AI to be effectively immortal could avoid the historical succession problem that explains the end of past totalitarian regimes.

## Safety Implications and Dystopian Scenarios

The safety implications of lock-in extend beyond traditional existential risk categories. Toby Ord's concept of "dystopian lock-in" suggests that scenarios where humanity survives but in a permanently degraded state might be as bad as extinction—perhaps worse, given their potential duration. An AI-enabled totalitarian state that persists for millions of years, a value system that eliminates human autonomy permanently, or an economic structure that condemns most humans to perpetual suffering could represent outcomes as catastrophic as human extinction.

These scenarios are concerning because they might emerge gradually and initially appear beneficial. An AI system that reduces crime through comprehensive surveillance might gain public support before its restrictions become irreversible. An economic system that increases productivity through AI optimization might be adopted widely before its concentration of power becomes apparent. A governance system that enhances stability and efficiency might seem preferable to messy democracy until the capacity for self-correction is permanently lost.

The timeline for recognizing and correcting these problems might be compressed compared to historical analogs. While human institutions evolved slowly enough for course corrections, AI-driven changes could occur faster than human decision-making processes can adapt. By the time problems become apparent, the systems might already be too entrenched to modify.

## The Critical Window: Current Trajectory and Urgency

Evidence suggests we may currently be in the critical period where permanent structures are being established. The <R id="da390c7cc819b788">AI Safety Clock</R>, maintained by IMD's TONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation, provides a symbolic measure of urgency. The clock launched at 29 minutes to midnight in September 2024, moved to 26 minutes in December 2024, reached 24 minutes by February 2025, and as of September 2025 stands at <R id="23067a0dd2856cc6">20 minutes to midnight</R>—a nine-minute advance in just one year. Key factors driving these adjustments include Sam Altman's November 2024 statement that AGI within five years is feasible, California's veto of SB 1047 safety legislation, and the rise of agentic AI systems.

The current trajectory shows concerning trends across multiple dimensions. In value alignment, major AI developers are making foundational choices about which values to embed in systems without broad democratic input. Constitutional AI approaches are becoming standardized, potentially locking in particular interpretations of human values. In geopolitical competition, countries are racing to achieve AI dominance, with early leaders potentially able to shape global AI governance according to their preferences.

Economic concentration is accelerating as AI capabilities become central to competitive advantage. Research published in <R id="d9cd3292030e2674">Policy and Society</R> documents how the launch of ChatGPT has further accelerated power concentration, with a "compute divide" emerging between Big Tech and conventional research centers. Cases like OpenAI's investment from Microsoft and Anthropic's from Amazon illustrate that even independent developers get co-opted by large technology companies. A small number of companies control the computational resources, data, and talent necessary for frontier AI development. If this concentration continues, these entities could gain unprecedented influence over human affairs. Technical standards and infrastructure choices made today—about AI architectures, training methodologies, and deployment frameworks—could become increasingly difficult to change as systems scale and integrate.

## Near-term Outlook (1-2 Years)

The immediate future will likely see continued consolidation of AI capabilities among leading developers, increasing the risk of premature lock-in of their particular approaches to AI safety and alignment. <R id="e99a5c1697baa07d">Constitutional AI</R> and similar value-loading techniques may become industry standard without sufficient consideration of whose values are being embedded or whether they can be modified later. Anthropic's <R id="3c862a18b467640b">Collective Constitutional AI research</R> represents one attempt to incorporate democratic input, but whether such approaches will be widely adopted remains uncertain. Geopolitical competition will likely intensify, with early advantages in AI capabilities potentially translating into long-term dominance.

Regulatory frameworks being established now will shape the landscape for AI development globally. The EU's AI Act, China's AI regulations, and emerging US federal oversight represent foundational choices about how AI development will be governed. These frameworks could become entrenched as institutions, expertise, and expectations build around them. International coordination mechanisms—or the lack thereof—established during this period may determine whether any single country can make unilateral decisions that affect global AI development.

## Medium-term Trajectory (2-5 Years)

The medium-term period may see the emergence of AI systems capable of autonomous research and development, potentially accelerating lock-in risks significantly. If AI systems can improve themselves or design successor systems, the window for human oversight and course correction may close rapidly. Economic and political structures adapted to current AI capabilities may become obsolete, creating instability that could lead to hasty decisions with permanent consequences.

Value lock-in risks may become more apparent as AI systems begin directly shaping human behavior and social structures. Early experiments in AI governance, education, and social coordination will provide evidence about whether these systems can be modified and redirected or whether early design choices prove irreversible. The success or failure of democratic oversight of AI development during this period may determine whether course correction remains possible in the long term.

## Key Uncertainties and Open Questions

Critical uncertainties remain about the fundamental nature of lock-in risks. It's unclear whether truly permanent lock-in is possible or whether human adaptability and technological change will eventually enable course correction regardless of initial conditions. The relationship between AI capability and lock-in risk is also uncertain—more capable AI might enable better solutions to lock-in risks, or it might make lock-in more likely and more permanent.

The question of democratic legitimacy for AI governance decisions remains largely unresolved. How can global decisions about AI development be made with sufficient input from affected populations? What institutions could provide legitimate oversight of AI development while moving quickly enough to address safety concerns? The tension between preventing lock-in through diverse approaches and coordinating on safety standards presents an ongoing challenge.

Perhaps most fundamentally, uncertainty about human values themselves complicates efforts to prevent value lock-in. If humanity has "moral blind spots" similar to historical acceptance of slavery or oppression, attempting to lock in current values might be as dangerous as allowing arbitrary value lock-in to occur. Balancing the need to prevent obviously harmful lock-in with humility about moral progress represents one of the most difficult challenges in AI governance.

The pace and predictability of AI development introduce additional uncertainty about when critical decisions must be made and how much time remains for deliberation and course correction. If AI capabilities advance discontinuously, the window for preventing lock-in might close suddenly and without warning. Conversely, if development proves more gradual and predictable, there may be more opportunities for democratic input and iterative improvement of AI governance frameworks.

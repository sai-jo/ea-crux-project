llmSummary: This mathematical model analyzes AI capability diffusion across 5
  actor tiers, finding that proliferation timelines have compressed from 24-36
  months to 12-18 months and may reach 6-12 months by 2025-2026. The model
  identifies compute governance and pre-proliferation decision gates as
  high-leverage interventions, while post-proliferation controls become
  ineffective once capabilities reach open source (Tier 4).

## Overview

This model analyzes the diffusion of AI capabilities from frontier laboratories to progressively broader populations of actors. It examines proliferation mechanisms, control points, and the relationship between diffusion speed and risk accumulation. The central question: **How fast do dangerous AI capabilities spread from frontier labs to millions of users, and which intervention points offer meaningful leverage?**

Key findings show proliferation follows predictable tier-based patterns, but time constants are compressing dramatically. Capabilities that took 24-36 months to diffuse from Tier 1 (frontier labs) to Tier 4 (open source) in 2020 now spread in 12-18 months. Projections suggest 6-12 month cycles by 2025-2026, fundamentally changing governance calculus.

The model identifies an "irreversibility threshold" where proliferation cannot be reversed once capabilities reach open source. This threshold is crossed earlier than commonly appreciated—often before policymakers recognize capabilities as dangerous. High-leverage interventions must occur pre-proliferation; post-proliferation controls offer diminishing returns as diffusion accelerates.

## Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk Dimension | Current Assessment | 2025-2026 Projection | Evidence | Trend |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|-------|
| **Diffusion Speed** | High | Very High | 50% reduction in proliferation timelines since 2020 | Accelerating |
| **Control Window** | Medium | Low | 12-18 month average control periods | Shrinking |
| **Actor Proliferation** | High | Very High | Tier 4 access growing exponentially | Expanding |
| **Irreversibility Risk** | High | Extreme | Multiple capabilities already irreversibly proliferated | Increasing |

## Proliferation Tier Analysis

### Actor Tier Classification

The proliferation cascade operates through five distinct actor tiers, each with different access mechanisms, resource requirements, and risk profiles.

| Tier | Actor Type | Count | Access Mechanism | Diffusion Time | Control Feasibility |
|------|------------|-------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Frontier Labs | 5-10 | Original development | - | High (concentrated) |
| **2** | Major Tech | 50-100 | API/Partnerships | 6-18 months | Medium-High |
| **3** | Well-Resourced Orgs | 1K-10K | Fine-tuning/Replication | 12-24 months | Medium |
| **4** | Open Source | Millions | Public weights | 18-36 months | Very Low |
| **5** | Individuals | Billions | Consumer apps | 24-48 months | None |

### Historical Diffusion Data

Analysis of actual proliferation timelines reveals accelerating diffusion across multiple capability domains:

| Capability | Tier 1 Date | Tier 4 Date | Total Time | Key Events |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **GPT-3 level** | May 2020 | Jul 2022 | 26 months | OpenAI → HuggingFace release |
| **DALL-E level** | Jan 2021 | Aug 2022 | 19 months | OpenAI → Stable Diffusion |
| **GPT-4 level** | Mar 2023 | Jan 2025 | 22 months | OpenAI → DeepSeek-R1 |
| **Code generation** | Aug 2021 | Dec 2022 | 16 months | Codex → StarCoder |
| **Protein folding** | Nov 2020 | Jul 2021 | 8 months | AlphaFold → ColabFold |

## Mathematical Model

### Core Risk Equation

Total proliferation risk combines actor count, capability level, and misuse probability:

$$R_{\text{total}}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} N_i(t) \cdot C_i(t) \cdot P_{\text{misuse},i}$$

Where:
- $N_i(t)$ = Number of actors in tier $i$ with access at time $t$
- $C_i(t)$ = Capability level accessible to tier $i$ at time $t$  
- $P_{\text{misuse},i}$ = Per-actor misuse probability for tier $i$

### Diffusion Dynamics

Each tier transition follows modified logistic growth with accelerating rates:

$$N_i(t) = \frac{N_{i,\max}}{1 + e^{-k_i(t - t_{0,i})}}$$

The acceleration factor captures increasing diffusion speed:

$$k_i(t) = k_{i,0} \cdot e^{\alpha t}$$

With $\alpha \approx 0.15$ per year, implying diffusion rates double every ~5 years. This matches observed compression from 24-36 month cycles (2020) to 12-18 months (2024).

## Proliferation Scenarios

### 2025-2030 Trajectory Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Tier 1-4 Time | Key Drivers | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|

### Threshold Analysis

Critical proliferation thresholds mark qualitative shifts in control feasibility:

| Threshold | Description | Control Status | Response Window |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Contained** | Tier 1-2 only | Control possible | Months |
| **Organizational** | Tier 3 access | State/criminal access likely | Weeks |

## Risk by Actor Type

### Misuse Probability Assessment

Different actor types present distinct risk profiles based on capability access and motivation:

| Actor Type | Estimated Count | Capability Access | P(Access) | P(Misuse\|Access) | Risk Weight |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Hostile state programs** | 5-15 | Frontier | 0.95 | 0.15-0.40 | Very High |
| **Major criminal orgs** | 50-200 | Near-frontier | 0.70-0.85 | 0.30-0.60 | High |
| **Terrorist groups** | 100-500 | Moderate | 0.40-0.70 | 0.50-0.80 | High |
| **Ideological groups** | 1K-10K | Moderate | 0.50-0.80 | 0.10-0.30 | Medium |
| **Malicious individuals** | 10K-100K | Basic-Moderate | 0.60-0.90 | 0.01-0.10 | Medium (scale) |

### Expected Misuse Events

Even low individual misuse probabilities become concerning at scale:

$$E[\text{misuse events}] = \sum_i N_i \cdot P(\text{access})_i \cdot P(\text{misuse}|\text{access})_i$$

For Tier 4-5 proliferation with 100,000 capable actors and 5% misuse probability, expected annual misuse events: **5,000**.

## Current State & Trajectory

### Recent Developments

The proliferation landscape has shifted dramatically since 2023:

**2023 Developments:**
- [LLaMA leak](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse) demonstrated fragility of controlled releases
- [LLaMA 2 open release](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) established new norm for frontier model sharing
- [U.S. export controls](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/export-controls-on-semiconductor) on advanced semiconductors implemented

**2024-2025 Developments:**
- [DeepSeek R1 release](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) achieved GPT-4 level performance with open weights
- [Qwen 2.5](https://qwenlm.github.io/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) continued aggressive open-source strategy
- Chinese labs increasingly releasing frontier capabilities openly

### 2025-2030 Projections

**Accelerating Factors:**
- Algorithmic efficiency reducing compute requirements ~2x annually
- China developing domestic chip capabilities to circumvent controls
- Open-source ideology gaining ground in AI community
- Economic incentives for ecosystem building through open models

**Decelerating Factors:**
- Growing awareness of proliferation risks among frontier labs
- Potential regulatory intervention following AI incidents
- Voluntary industry agreements on responsible disclosure
- Technical barriers to replicating frontier training runs

## Key Uncertainties

### Critical Unknown Parameters

| Uncertainty | Impact on Model | Current State | Resolution Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Chinese chip development** | Very High | 2-3 generations behind | 3-7 years |
| **Algorithmic efficiency gains** | High | ~2x annual improvement | Ongoing |
| **Open vs closed norms** | Very High | Trending toward open | 1-3 years |
| **Regulatory intervention** | High | Minimal but increasing | 2-5 years |
| **Major AI incident** | Very High | None yet | Unpredictable |

### Model Sensitivity Analysis

The model is most sensitive to three parameters:

**Diffusion Rate Acceleration (α):** 10% change in α yields 25-40% change in risk estimates over 5-year horizon. This parameter depends heavily on continued algorithmic progress and open-source community growth.

**Tier 4/5 Misuse Probability:** Uncertainty ranges from 1-15% create order-of-magnitude differences in expected incidents. Better empirical data on malicious actor populations is critical.

**Compute Control Durability:** Estimates ranging from 3-15 years until circumvention dramatically affect intervention value. China's semiconductor progress is the key uncertainty.

## Policy Implications

### Immediate Actions (0-18 months)

**Strengthen Compute Governance:**
- Expand semiconductor export controls to cover training and inference chips
- Implement cloud provider monitoring for large training runs
- Establish international coordination on chip supply chain security

**Establish Evaluation Frameworks:**
- Define dangerous capability thresholds with measurable criteria
- Create mandatory pre-deployment evaluation requirements
- Build verification infrastructure for model capabilities

### Medium-Term Priorities (18 months-5 years)

**International Coordination:**
- Negotiate binding agreements on proliferation control
- Establish verification mechanisms for training run detection
- Create sanctions framework for violating proliferation norms

**Industry Standards:**
- Implement weight security requirements for frontier models
- Establish differential access policies based on actor verification
- Create liability frameworks for irresponsible proliferation

### Long-Term Structural Changes (5+ years)

**Governance Architecture:**
- Build adaptive regulatory systems that evolve with technology
- Establish international AI safety organization with enforcement powers
- Create sustainable funding for proliferation monitoring infrastructure

**Research Priorities:**
- Develop better offensive-defensive balance understanding
- Create empirical measurement systems for proliferation tracking
- Build tools for post-proliferation risk mitigation

## Research Gaps

Several critical uncertainties limit model precision and policy effectiveness:

**Empirical Proliferation Tracking:** Systematic measurement of capability diffusion timelines across domains remains limited. Most analysis relies on high-profile case studies rather than comprehensive data collection.

**Reverse Engineering Difficulty:** Time and resources required to replicate capabilities from limited information varies dramatically across capability types. Better understanding could inform targeted protection strategies.

**Actor Intent Modeling:** Current misuse probability estimates rely on theoretical analysis rather than empirical study of malicious actor populations and motivations.

**Control Mechanism Effectiveness:** Rigorous testing of governance interventions is lacking. Most effectiveness estimates derive from analogies to other domains rather than AI-specific validation.

**Defensive Capability Development:** The model focuses on capability proliferation while ignoring parallel development of defensive tools that could partially offset risks.

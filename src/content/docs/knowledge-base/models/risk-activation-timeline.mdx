llmSummary: This model systematically maps when different AI risks become critical based on capability thresholds, categorizing current risks (disinformation, economic displacement), near-term risks activating by 2025-2027 (bioweapons, cyberweapons), and long-term existential risks requiring superintelligence. It provides specific activation windows, progress percentages toward thresholds, and identifies cascade effects between risk categories.

## Overview

Different AI risks don't all "turn on" at the same time - they activate based on capability thresholds, deployment contexts, and barrier erosion. This model systematically maps when various AI risks become critical, enabling strategic resource allocation and intervention timing.

The model reveals three critical insights: many serious risks are already active with current systems, the next 2-3 years represent a critical activation window for multiple high-impact risks, and long-term existential risks require foundational research investment now despite uncertain timelines.

Understanding activation timing enables prioritizing immediate interventions for active risks, preparing defenses for near-term thresholds, and building foundational capacity for long-term challenges before crisis mode sets in.

## Risk Assessment Overview

| Risk Category | Timeline | Severity Range | Current Status | Intervention Window |
|---------------|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Current Active** | 2020-2024 | Medium-High | Multiple risks active | Closing rapidly |
| **Near-term Critical** | 2025-2027 | High-Extreme | Approaching thresholds | Open but narrowing |
| **Long-term Existential** | 2030-2050+ | Extreme-Catastrophic | Early warning signs | Wide but requires early action |
| **Cascade Effects** | Ongoing | Amplifies all categories | Accelerating | Immediate intervention needed |

## Risk Activation Framework

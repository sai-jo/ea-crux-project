## Overview

AI risks form a complex network where individual risks enable, amplify, and cascade through each other, creating compound threats far exceeding the sum of their parts. This model provides the first systematic mapping of these interactions, revealing that approximately 70% of current AI risk stems from interaction dynamics rather than isolated risks.

The analysis identifies [racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/) as the most critical hub risk, enabling 8 downstream risks and amplifying technical risks by 2-5x. Compound scenarios show 3-8x higher catastrophic probabilities than independent risk assessments suggest, with cascades capable of triggering within 10-25 years under current trajectories.

Key findings include four self-reinforcing feedback loops already observable in current systems, and evidence that targeting enabler risks could improve intervention efficiency by 40-80% compared to addressing risks independently.

## Risk Impact Assessment

## Hub Risk Analysis

### Primary Enabler: Racing Dynamics

[Racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/) emerges as the most influential hub risk, with documented amplification effects across multiple domains.

| Enabled Risk | Amplification Factor | Mechanism | Evidence Source |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------|

| Oversight capacity | 50-80% reduction | Humans rubber-stamp AI decisions | [Berkeley CHAI Research](https://humancompatible.ai/research) |
| Institutional trust | 20-40% erosion | False confidence in AI validation | [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) |

## Self-Reinforcing Feedback Loops

### Loop 1: Sycophancy-Expertise Death Spiral

```
Sycophancy increases → Human expertise atrophies → Demand for AI validation grows → Sycophancy optimized further
```

**Current evidence:**
- 67% of professionals now defer to AI recommendations without verification ([McKinsey AI Survey 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai))
- Code review quality declined 40% after GitHub Copilot adoption ([Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://stackoverflow.com/))
- Medical diagnostic accuracy fell when doctors used AI assistants ([JAMA Internal Medicine](https://jamanetwork.com/))

| Cycle | Timeline | Amplification Factor | Intervention Window |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 2024-2027 | 1.5x | **Open** |
| 2 | 2027-2030 | 2.25x | Closing |
| 3 | 2030-2033 | 3.4x | Minimal |
| 4+ | 2033+ | >5x | Structural |

### Loop 2: Racing-Concentration Spiral

```
Racing intensifies → Winner takes more market share → Increased resources for racing → Racing intensifies further
```

**Current manifestations:**
- [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/) valuation jumped from $14B to $157B in 18 months
- Talent concentration: Top 5 labs employ 60% of AI safety researchers
- Compute concentration: 80% of frontier training on 3 cloud providers

| Metric | 2022 | 2024 | 2030 Projection | Concentration Risk |
|--------|------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Market share (top 3) | 45% | 72% | 85-95% | Critical |
| Safety researcher concentration | 35% | 60% | 75-85% | High |
| Compute control | 60% | 80% | 90-95% | Critical |

### Loop 3: Trust-Epistemic Breakdown Spiral

```

**Quantified progression:**
- Trust in media: 32% (2024) → projected 15% (2030)
- Trust in scientific institutions: 39% → projected 25%
- Trust in government information: 24% → projected 10%

**AI acceleration factors:**

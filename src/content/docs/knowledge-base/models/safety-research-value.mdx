llmSummary: This model analyzes expected value of AI safety research investments, finding current funding levels ($500M/year) significantly below optimal with 2-5x returns available in neglected areas like alignment theory and governance research. It estimates safety research could reduce AI risk by 20-40% and recommends reallocating resources toward theoretical work and away from RLHF-focused research.

## Overview

This economic model quantifies the expected value of marginal investments in AI safety research. Current global spending of ~$500M annually on safety research appears significantly below optimal levels, with analysis suggesting 2-5x returns available in neglected areas.

Key findings: Safety research could reduce AI catastrophic risk by 20-40% over the next decade, with particularly high returns in alignment theory and governance research. Current 100:1 ratio of capabilities to safety spending creates systematic underinvestment in risk mitigation.

The model incorporates deep uncertainty about AI risk probabilities (1-20% existential risk this century), tractability of safety problems, and optimal resource allocation across different research approaches.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence | Source |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Current Underinvestment** | High | 100:1 capabilities vs safety ratio | [Epoch AI (2024)](https://epochai.org/blog/trends-in-machine-learning-funding) |
| **Marginal Returns** | Medium-High | 2-5x potential in neglected areas | [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-ai-safety/) |
| **Timeline Sensitivity** | High | Value drops 50%+ if timelines \<5 years | [AI Impacts Survey](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) |
| **Research Direction Risk** | Medium | 10-100x variance between approaches | Analysis based on expert interviews |

## Strategic Framework

### Core Expected Value Equation

```
EV = P(AI catastrophe) × R(research impact) × V(prevented harm) - C(research costs)

Where:
- P ∈ [0.01, 0.20]: Probability of catastrophic AI outcome
- R ∈ [0.05, 0.40]: Fractional risk reduction from research
- V ≈ $10¹⁵-10¹⁷: Value of prevented catastrophic harm
- C ≈ $10⁹: Annual research investment
```

### Investment Priority Matrix

| Research Area | Current Annual Funding | Marginal Returns | Evidence Quality |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Alignment Theory** | $50M | High (5-10x) | Low |
| **Interpretability** | $175M | Medium (2-3x) | Medium |
| **Evaluations** | $100M | High (3-5x) | High |
| **Governance Research** | $50M | High (4-8x) | Medium |
| **RLHF/Fine-tuning** | $125M | Low (1-2x) | High |

- Industry maintains 50-60% share

**Bottlenecks limiting growth:**
1. **Talent pipeline:** ~1,000 qualified researchers globally
2. **Research direction clarity:** Uncertainty about most valuable approaches
3. **Access to frontier models:** Safety research requires cutting-edge systems

## Key Uncertainties & Research Cruxes

### Fundamental Disagreements

| Dimension | Optimistic View | Pessimistic View | Current Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **AI Risk Level** | 2-5% x-risk probability | 15-20% x-risk probability | [Expert surveys](https://aiimpacts.org/) show 5-10% median |
| **Alignment Tractability** | Solvable with sufficient research | Fundamentally intractable | Mixed signals from early work |
| **Timeline Sensitivity** | Decades to solve problems | Need solutions in 3-7 years | Acceleration in capabilities suggests shorter timelines |
| **Research Transferability** | Insights transfer across architectures | Approach-specific solutions | Limited evidence either way |

### Critical Research Questions

**Empirical questions that would change investment priorities:**

1. **Interpretability scaling:** Do current techniques work on 100B+ parameter models?
2. **Alignment tax:** What performance cost do safety measures impose?
3. **Adversarial robustness:** Can safety measures withstand optimization pressure?
4. **Governance effectiveness:** Do AI safety standards actually get implemented?

### Information Value Estimates

**Value of resolving key uncertainties:**

| Question | Value of Information | Timeline to Resolution |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Alignment difficulty | $1-10B | 3-7 years |
| Interpretability scaling | $500M-5B | 2-5 years |
| Governance effectiveness | $100M-1B | 5-10 years |
| Risk probability | $10-100B | Uncertain |

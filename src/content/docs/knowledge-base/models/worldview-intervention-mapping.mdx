## Overview

This model maps how beliefs about AI risk create distinct worldview clusters with dramatically different intervention priorities. Different worldviews imply 2-10x differences in optimal resource allocation across pause advocacy, technical research, and governance work. 

The model identifies that misalignment between personal beliefs and work focus may waste 20-50% of field resources. [AI safety researchers](https://www.anthropic.com/research) hold fundamentally different assumptions about timelines, technical difficulty, and coordination feasibility, but these differences often don't translate to coherent intervention choices.

The framework reveals four major worldview clusters - from "doomer" (short timelines + hard alignment) prioritizing pause advocacy, to "technical optimist" (medium timelines + tractable alignment) emphasizing research investment.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Severity** | High | 2-10x resource allocation differences across worldviews | Immediate |
| **Likelihood** | Very High | Systematic worldview-work mismatches observed | Ongoing |
| **Scope** | Field-wide | Affects individual researchers, orgs, and funders | All levels |
| **Trend** | Worsening | Field growth without explicit worldview coordination | 2024-2027 |

## Strategic Question Framework

**Given your beliefs about AI risk, which interventions should you prioritize?**

The core problem: People work on interventions that don't match their stated beliefs about AI development. This model makes explicit which interventions are most valuable under specific worldview assumptions.

### How to Use This Framework

| Step | Action | Tool |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Identify worldview** | Assess beliefs on timeline/difficulty/coordination |
| 2 | **Check priorities** | Map beliefs to intervention recommendations |
| 3 | **Audit alignment** | Compare current work to worldview implications |
| 4 | **Adjust strategy** | Either change work focus or update worldview |

## Core Worldview Dimensions

Three belief dimensions drive most disagreement about intervention priorities:

### Dimension 1: Timeline Beliefs

| Timeline | Key Beliefs | Strategic Constraints | Supporting Evidence |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Short (2025-2030)** | AGI within 5 years; scaling continues; few obstacles | Little time for institutional change; must work with existing structures | [Amodei prediction](https://www.anthropic.com/news/ceo-letter) of powerful AI by 2026-2027 |
| **Medium (2030-2040)** | Transformative AI in 10-15 years; surmountable obstacles | Time for institution-building; research can mature | [Metaculus consensus](https://www.metaculus.com/) ~2032 for AGI |
| **Long (2040+)** | Major obstacles remain; slow takeoff; decades available | Full institutional development possible; fundamental research valuable | [MIRI position](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/) on alignment difficulty |

### Dimension 2: Alignment Difficulty

| Difficulty | Core Assumptions | Research Implications | Current Status |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Hard** | Alignment fundamentally unsolved; deception likely; current techniques inadequate | Technical solutions insufficient; need to slow/stop development | [Scheming research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/sleeper-agents-training-deceptive-llms) shows deception possible |
| **Medium** | Alignment difficult but tractable; techniques improve with scale | Technical research highly valuable; sustained investment needed | [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) shows promise |
| **Tractable** | Alignment largely solved; RLHF + interpretability sufficient | Focus on deployment governance; limited technical urgency | [OpenAI safety approach](https://openai.com/safety) assumes tractability |

### Dimension 3: Coordination Feasibility

| Feasibility | Institutional View | Policy Implications | Historical Precedent |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Feasible** | Treaties possible; labs coordinate; racing avoidable | Invest heavily in coordination mechanisms | Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Montreal Protocol |
| **Difficult** | Partial coordination; major actors defect; limited cooperation | Focus on willing actors; partial governance | Climate agreements with partial compliance |
| **Impossible** | Pure competition; no stable equilibria; universal racing | Technical safety only; governance futile | Failed disarmament during arms races |

`} />

### Cluster 1: "Doomer" Worldview
**Beliefs:** Short timelines + Hard alignment + Coordination difficult

| Intervention Category | Priority | Expected ROI | Key Advocates |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Pause/slowdown advocacy | **Very High** | 10x+ if successful | [Eliezer Yudkowsky](/knowledge-base/people/eliezer-yudkowsky/) |
| [Compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) | **Very High** | 5-8x via bottlenecks | [RAND reports](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2974-1.html) |
| Technical safety research | **High** | 2-4x (low prob, high value) | [MIRI](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/miri/) approach |
| International coordination | **Medium** | 8x if achieved (low prob) | [FHI governance work](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) |
| Field-building | **Low** | 1-2x (insufficient time) | Long-term capacity building |
| Public engagement | **Medium** | 3-5x via political support | [Pause AI movement](https://pauseai.info/) |

**Coherence Check:** If you believe this worldview but work on field-building or long-term institution design, your work may be misaligned with your beliefs.

### Cluster 2: "Technical Optimist" Worldview
**Beliefs:** Medium timelines + Medium difficulty + Coordination possible

| Intervention Category | Priority | Expected ROI | Leading Organizations |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| [Technical safety research](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/) | **Very High** | 8-12x via direct solutions | [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/), [Redwood](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/redwood/) |
| [Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/interpretability/) | **Very High** | 6-10x via understanding | [Chris Olah's work](/knowledge-base/people/chris-olah/) |
| Lab safety standards | **High** | 4-6x via industry norms | [Partnership on AI](https://partnershiponai.org/) |
| [Compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) | **Medium** | 3-5x supplementary value | [CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/) research |
| Pause advocacy | **Low** | 1x or negative (unnecessary) | Premature intervention |
| Field-building | **High** | 5-8x via capacity | [CHAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/chai/), [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) |

**Coherence Check:** If you believe this worldview but work on pause advocacy or aggressive regulation, your efforts may be counterproductive.

### Cluster 3: "Governance-Focused" Worldview
**Beliefs:** Medium-long timelines + Medium difficulty + Coordination feasible

| Intervention Category | Priority | Expected ROI | Key Institutions |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| [International coordination](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/international/) | **Very High** | 10-15x via global governance | [UK AISI](/knowledge-base/organizations/government/uk-aisi/), [US AISI](/knowledge-base/organizations/government/us-aisi/) |
| [Domestic regulation](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/legislation/) | **Very High** | 6-10x via norm-setting | [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence) |
| Institution-building | **Very High** | 8-12x via capacity | [AI Safety Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/) development |
| Technical standards | **High** | 4-6x enabling governance | [NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) |
| Technical research | **Medium** | 3-5x (others lead) | Research coordination role |
| Pause advocacy | **Low** | 1-2x premature | Governance development first |

**Coherence Check:** If you believe this worldview but focus purely on technical research, you may be underutilizing comparative advantage.

### Cluster 4: "Accelerationist/Optimist" Worldview
**Beliefs:** Any timeline + Tractable alignment + Any coordination level

| Intervention Category | Priority | Expected ROI | Rationale |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Capability development | **Very High** | 15-25x via benefits | AI solves problems faster than creates them |
| Deployment governance | **Medium** | 2-4x addressing specific harms | Targeted harm prevention |
| Technical safety | **Low** | 1-2x already adequate | RLHF sufficient for current systems |
| Pause/slowdown | **Very Low** | Negative ROI | Delays beneficial AI |
| Aggressive regulation | **Very Low** | Large negative ROI | Stifles innovation unnecessarily |

**Coherence Check:** If you hold this worldview but work on safety research or pause advocacy, your work contradicts your beliefs about AI risk levels.

## Intervention Effectiveness Matrix

The following analysis shows how intervention effectiveness varies dramatically across worldviews:

| Intervention | Short+Hard (Doomer) | Short+Tractable (Sprint) | Long+Hard (Patient) | Long+Tractable (Optimist) |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Pause/slowdown** | Very High (10x) | Low (1x) | Medium (4x) | Very Low (-2x) |
| **[Compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/)** | Very High (8x) | Medium (3x) | High (6x) | Low (1x) |
| **Alignment research** | High (3x) | Low (2x) | Very High (12x) | Low (1x) |
| **[Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/interpretability/)** | High (4x) | Medium (5x) | Very High (10x) | Medium (3x) |
| **International treaties** | Medium (2x) | Low (1x) | Very High (15x) | Medium (4x) |
| **Domestic regulation** | Medium (3x) | Medium (4x) | High (8x) | Medium (3x) |
| **Lab safety standards** | High (6x) | High (7x) | High (8x) | Medium (4x) |
| **Field-building** | Low (1x) | Low (2x) | Very High (12x) | Medium (5x) |
| **Public engagement** | Medium (4x) | Low (2x) | High (7x) | Low (1x) |

<Aside type="caution" title="Critical Insight">
Working on "Very High" priority interventions under the wrong worldview can waste 5-10x resources compared to optimal allocation. This represents one of the largest efficiency losses in the AI safety field.

## Portfolio Strategies for Uncertainty

### Timeline Uncertainty Management

| Uncertainty Level | Recommended Allocation | Hedge Strategy |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **50/50 short vs long** | 60% urgent interventions, 40% patient capital | Compute governance + field-building |
| **70% short, 30% long** | 80% urgent, 20% patient with option value | Standards + some institution-building |
| **30% short, 70% long** | 40% urgent, 60% patient development | Institution-building + some standards |

### Alignment Difficulty Hedging

| Belief Distribution | Technical Research | Governance/Coordination | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **50% hard, 50% tractable** | 40% allocation | 60% allocation | Governance has value regardless |
| **80% hard, 20% tractable** | 20% allocation | 80% allocation | Focus on buying time |
| **20% hard, 80% tractable** | 70% allocation | 30% allocation | Technical solutions likely |

### Coordination Feasibility Strategies

| Scenario | Unilateral Capacity | Multilateral Investment | Leading Actor Focus |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **High coordination feasibility** | 20% | 60% | 20% |
| **Medium coordination feasibility** | 40% | 40% | 20% |
| **Low coordination feasibility** | 60% | 10% | 30% |

## Current State & Trajectory

### Field-Wide Worldview Distribution

| Worldview Cluster | Estimated Prevalence | Resource Allocation | Alignment Score |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Doomer** | 15-20% of researchers | ~30% of resources | **Moderate** misalignment |
| **Technical Optimist** | 40-50% of researchers | ~45% of resources | **Good** alignment |
| **Governance-Focused** | 25-30% of researchers | ~20% of resources | **Poor** alignment |
| **Accelerationist** | 5-10% of researchers | ~5% of resources | **Unknown** |

### Observed Misalignment Patterns

Based on [AI Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/) surveys and [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) career advising:

| Common Mismatch | Frequency | Estimated Efficiency Loss |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| "Short timelines" researcher doing field-building | 25% of junior researchers | 3-5x effectiveness loss |
| "Alignment solved" researcher doing safety work | 15% of technical researchers | 2-3x effectiveness loss |
| "Coordination impossible" researcher doing policy | 10% of policy researchers | 4-6x effectiveness loss |

### 2024-2027 Trajectory Predictions

| Trend | Likelihood | Impact on Field Efficiency |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Increased worldview polarization** | High | -20% to -30% efficiency |
| **Better worldview-work matching** | Medium | +15% to +25% efficiency |
| **Explicit worldview institutions** | Low | +30% to +50% efficiency |

## Key Uncertainties & Cruxes

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "What's the actual distribution of worldviews among AI safety researchers?",
    "How much does worldview-work mismatch reduce field effectiveness quantitatively?",
    "Can people reliably identify and articulate their own worldview assumptions?",
    "Would explicit worldview discussion increase coordination or create harmful polarization?",
    "How quickly should people update worldviews based on new evidence?",
    "Do comparative advantages sometimes override worldview-based prioritization?"

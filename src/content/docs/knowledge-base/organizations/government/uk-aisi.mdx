## Summary

The UK AI Safety Institute (UK AISI) is a government organization established in 2023 to advance AI safety through research, evaluation, and international coordination. Created in the wake of the first AI Safety Summit hosted by the UK government, AISI represents the UK's commitment to being a global leader in AI safety and governance.

As one of the first government bodies specifically dedicated to advanced AI safety (alongside the US AISI), the UK AISI plays a pioneering role in translating AI safety research into government policy and practice. The organization conducts technical research on AI risks, evaluates frontier models for dangerous capabilities, develops safety standards, and coordinates international efforts to ensure safe AI development.

The UK AISI's strategic positioning reflects the UK government's ambition: to be a global hub for AI safety, bridging technical research communities, frontier AI labs, and international policymakers.

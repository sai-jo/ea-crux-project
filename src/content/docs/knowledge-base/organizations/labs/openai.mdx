## Overview

OpenAI is the AI research company that catalyzed mainstream artificial intelligence adoption through ChatGPT and the GPT model series. Founded in 2015 as a non-profit with the mission to ensure AGI benefits humanity, OpenAI has undergone dramatic organizational evolution: from open research lab to secretive commercial entity, from safety-focused non-profit to product-driven corporation racing toward AGI.

The company achieved breakthrough capabilities through massive scale (GPT-3's 175B parameters), pioneered [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](/knowledge-base/debates/formal-arguments/why-alignment-easy/) as a practical alignment technique, and launched ChatGPT—the fastest-growing consumer application in history with 100 million users in two months. However, OpenAI's trajectory reveals mounting tensions between [commercial pressures and safety priorities](/knowledge-base/cruxes/solutions/), exemplified by the November 2023 board crisis that temporarily ousted CEO Sam Altman and the 2024 exodus of key safety researchers including co-founder Ilya Sutskever.

With over \$13 billion in Microsoft investment and aggressive capability advancement through reasoning models like o1, OpenAI sits at the center of debates about [AI safety governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/), racing dynamics, and whether commercial incentives can align with existential risk mitigation.

## Governance Crisis Analysis

### November 2023 Board Coup

| Timeline | Event | Stakeholders | Outcome |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Nov 17** | Board fires Sam Altman for lack of candor | Non-profit board, Ilya Sutskever | Initial dismissal |
| **Nov 18-19** | Employee revolt, Microsoft intervention | 500+ employees, Microsoft leadership | Pressure for reversal |
| **Nov 20** | Altman reinstated, board replaced | New commercial-aligned board | Governance weakened |

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Safety vs. commercialization priorities conflict
- Board concerns about [racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) and deployment pace
- Lack of transparency on safety research resource allocation
- Potential conflicts of interest in Altman's external investments

**Structural Implications:**
- Demonstrated employee and investor loyalty trumps mission governance
- Non-profit board cannot meaningfully constrain for-profit operations  
- Microsoft partnership creates de facto veto over safety-motivated decisions
- Sets precedent that commercial interests override safety governance

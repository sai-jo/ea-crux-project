## Overview

Conjecture is an AI safety research organization founded in 2021 by [Connor Leahy](/knowledge-base/people/connor-leahy/) and a team of researchers concerned about existential risks from advanced AI. The organization pursues a distinctive technical approach centered on "Cognitive Emulation" (CoEm) - building interpretable AI systems based on human cognition principles rather than aligning existing large language models.

Based in London with a team of 30-40 researchers, Conjecture raised over $30M in Series A funding in 2023. Their research agenda emphasizes mechanistic interpretability and understanding neural network internals, representing a fundamental alternative to mainstream [prosaic alignment approaches](/knowledge-base/arguments/why-alignment-hard/) pursued by organizations like [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/) and [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/).

## Founding and Evolution

### Origins (2021)

Conjecture emerged from the **EleutherAI** collective, an open-source AI research group that successfully recreated GPT-3 as open-source models (GPT-J, GPT-NeoX). Key founding factors:

| Factor | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| EleutherAI Experience | High | Demonstrated capability replication feasibility |
| Safety Concerns | High | Recognition of risks from capability proliferation |
| European Gap | Medium | Limited AI safety ecosystem outside Bay Area |
| Funding Availability | Medium | Growing investor interest in AI safety |

**Philosophical Evolution**: The transition from EleutherAI's "democratize AI" mission to Conjecture's safety-focused approach represents a significant shift in thinking about AI development and publication strategies.

### Funding Trajectory

| Year | Funding Stage | Amount | Impact |
|------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 2021 | Seed | Undisclosed | Initial team of ~15 researchers |
| 2023 | Series A | $30M+ | Scaled to 30-40 researchers |
| 2024 | Operating | Ongoing | Sustained research operations |

## Cognitive Emulation (CoEm) Research Agenda

### Core Philosophy

Conjecture's signature approach contrasts sharply with mainstream AI development:

| Approach | Philosophy | Methods | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Prosaic Alignment** | Train powerful LLMs, align post-hoc | RLHF, Constitutional AI | Behavioral testing |
| **Cognitive Emulation** | Build interpretable systems from ground up | Human cognition principles | Mechanistic understanding |

### Key Research Components

**Mechanistic Interpretability**
- Circuit discovery in neural networks
- Feature attribution and visualization

**Architecture Design**
- Modular systems for better control
- Interpretability-first design choices
- Trading capabilities for understanding
- Novel training methodologies

**Model Organisms**
- Smaller, interpretable test systems
- Alignment property verification
- Deception detection research
- Goal representation analysis

### Connor Leahy Profile

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Background** | EleutherAI collective member, GPT-J contributor |
| **Evolution** | From open-source advocacy to safety-focused research |
| **Public Role** | Active AI policy engagement, podcast appearances |
| **Views** | Short AI timelines, high P(doom), interpretability-necessary |

**Timeline Estimates**: Leahy has consistently expressed [short AI timeline](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/) views, suggesting AGI within years rather than decades.

## Research Focus Areas

### Mechanistic Interpretability

| Research Area | Status | Key Questions |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **Circuit Analysis** | Active | How do transformers implement reasoning? |
| **Feature Extraction** | Ongoing | What representations emerge in training? |
| **Scaling Methods** | Development | Can interpretability scale to AGI-level systems? |
| **Goal Detection** | Early | How can we detect goal-directedness mechanistically? |

### Comparative Advantages

| Organization | Primary Focus | Interpretability Approach |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Conjecture** | CoEm, ground-up interpretability | Design-time interpretability |
| **[Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/)** | Frontier models + interpretability | Post-hoc analysis of LLMs |
| **[ARC](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/arc/)** | Theoretical alignment | Evaluation and ELK research |
| **[Redwood](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/redwood/)** | AI control | Interpretability for control |

## Strategic Position

### Theory of Change

Conjecture's pathway to AI safety impact:

1. **Develop scalable interpretability techniques** for powerful AI systems
2. **Demonstrate CoEm viability** as competitive alternative to black-box scaling
3. **Influence field direction** toward interpretability-first development
4. **Inform governance** with technical feasibility insights
5. **Build safe systems** using CoEm principles if successful

### European AI Safety Hub

| **Human Cognition Complexity** | Medium | Ongoing investigation |
| **Timeline Alignment** | High | Critical if [AGI timelines](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/) short |

### Organizational Tensions

**Commercial Pressure vs Safety Mission**
- VC funding creates return expectations
- Potential future deployment pressure
- Comparison to [Anthropic's commercialization path](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/)

**Publication Strategy Criticism**

## Overview

FAR AI (Forecasting AI Research) is an AI safety research organization founded in 2023 by [Dan Hendrycks](/knowledge-base/people/dan-hendrycks/), focusing on adversarial robustness, model evaluation, and alignment research. The organization occupies a unique niche by combining rigorous empirical machine learning research with existential risk concerns.

Building on Hendrycks' influential benchmark work (MMLU, MATH datasets) and natural abstractions research, FAR AI aims to bridge the academic ML community with [AI safety research](/knowledge-base/responses/). Their approach emphasizes that robust AI systems are prerequisites for aligned systems, making adversarial robustness research a critical safety priority.

The organization has gained prominence for maintaining academic publication standards while keeping long-term AI safety as the central mission, helping legitimize safety research within mainstream ML circles.

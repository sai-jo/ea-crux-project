- Certified defenses
- Scalable robust training

**Robustness evaluation:**
- Testing models against adversarial attacks
- Benchmark development
- Worst-case performance analysis
- Identifying failure modes

**Connection to alignment:**
- Models must be robust to be reliably aligned

- Robustness research informs alignment techniques
- Safety requires worst-case guarantees

**Practical importance:**
- Deployed systems will face adversarial inputs
- Robustness necessary for safety-critical applications
- Foundation for trustworthy AI
- Prerequisite for alignment

### 2. Evaluation and Benchmarking

Building on Dan Hendrycks' benchmark expertise.

**Benchmark development:**
- Comprehensive capability testing

### 3. Natural Abstractions Research

**Theory**: Natural abstractions might be fundamental to intelligence and alignment.

**Concept:**
- Certain concepts are "natural" - discovered by different intelligent systems
- Mathematics, physics, causality may be universal abstractions
- If true, could help with alignment (shared concepts with AI)
- Foundation for interpretability and communication with AI

**Research questions:**
- What makes an abstraction "natural"?
- Do neural networks learn natural abstractions?
- Can we verify shared abstractions between humans and AI?
- Implications for alignment and communication?

**Connection to safety:**
- Shared abstractions could enable alignment verification
- Understanding what concepts AI learns
- Foundation for interpretability
- Theoretical grounding for empirical work

**Status**: Ongoing research area, highly theoretical but potentially foundational

### 4. Alignment Research

- Robustness of alignment under distribution shift
- Evaluation of alignment techniques
- Integration with adversarial robustness

**Approaches:**
- Empirical testing of alignment methods

## Criticisms and Challenges

### Limited Public Information

**Observation**: FAR AI relatively new and less publicly visible than some orgs

**Possible reasons:**

- Focus on research over PR
- Building foundations before public work
- Academic publication timeline (slow)

**Implication**: Hard to evaluate impact and direction

### Scope and Focus Questions

**Questions:**
- How does FAR AI differ from Hendrycks' previous work?
- What unique contributions beyond individual research?
- Organizational value-add vs. individual researcher?
- Long-term research agenda?

**Uncertainty**: Still early to assess organizational trajectory

### Robustness vs. Alignment

**Question**: How much does adversarial robustness help with alignment?

**Optimistic view:**
- Robust systems are prerequisite for aligned systems
- Adversarial thinking helps find alignment failures
- Evaluation methodology transfers
- Empirical rigor benefits both

**Skeptical view:**
- Robustness to adversarial examples ≠ aligned values
- Different problem types
- Might be useful but not sufficient
- Resources could go to direct alignment work

**FAR AI's likely position**: Robustness is necessary component of safety

### Academic Publishing Pace

**Challenge**: Academic publication timelines are slow

**Tension:**
- Rigorous peer review takes time
- AI capabilities advancing rapidly
- Need timely safety research
- Competitive dynamics with labs

**Trade-off:**
- Academic rigor vs. speed
- Credibility vs. timeliness
- Detailed vs. quick communication

**Balance**: Important to have both rapid and rigorous research

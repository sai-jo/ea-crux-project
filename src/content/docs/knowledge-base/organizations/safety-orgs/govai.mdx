## Summary

The Centre for the Governance of AI (GovAI) is a research organization focused on AI policy and governance. Originally part of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford, GovAI became independent in 2023 when FHI closed.

GovAI's mission is to help decision-makers navigate the transition to a world with advanced AI through rigorous research and talent development.

## Research Areas

### Compute Governance
Research on regulating AI through compute:
- Compute thresholds for regulation
- Hardware supply chain governance
- Chip tracking and verification

### International Coordination
How nations can coordinate on AI development:
- AI governance standards
- International AI agreements
- Race dynamics and cooperation

### AI Industry Structure
Understanding the AI landscape:
- Market concentration analysis
- Lab governance structures
- Open-source vs closed dynamics

### Risk Assessment
Analyzing AI development risks:
- Timelines and capability forecasting
- Catastrophic risk scenarios
- Governance gaps

## Key Research

### Compute Governance Framework
Developed influential framework for regulating AI via compute:
- Compute as a measurable input to AI capability
- Hardware controls as leverage point
- International verification possibilities

### International Standards
Research on how international standards can enable global AI coordination:
- Technical standards for safety
- Governance standards for labs
- Interoperability and verification

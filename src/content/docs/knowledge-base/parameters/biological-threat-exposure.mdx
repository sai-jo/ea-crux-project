## Overview

Biological Threat Exposure measures society's capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats—including AI-enabled bioweapon development. Technological investment, governance frameworks, and the offense-defense balance all determine whether biosecurity capacity strengthens or weakens over time.

This parameter underpins:
- **Prevention**: Ability to stop dangerous biological research and acquisition
- **Detection**: Surveillance systems that identify outbreaks early
- **Response**: Capacity to develop countermeasures and contain threats
- **Deterrence**: Reducing incentives for biological attacks

Understanding biosecurity as a parameter (rather than just a "bioweapons risk") enables symmetric analysis of both threats (AI-enabled offense) and defenses (AI-enabled detection), precise investment targeting across the biosecurity stack, trajectory assessment of whether the offense-defense balance is shifting, and threshold identification of minimum biosecurity capacity needed given advancing AI capabilities. This framing proves critical because advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology, combined with rapid innovations in machine learning, are enabling novel biological capabilities that experts characterize as "offense-dominant and extremely difficult to defend against."

## Current State Assessment

### Detection Capabilities

| System | Current Capability | Gap | Trend | 2025 Status |
|--------|-------------------|-----|-------|-------------|
| DNA synthesis screening | ~25% of dangerous sequences caught | 75% evade detection via AI design | Worsening (AI evasion) | Voluntary, patchy coverage |
| Metagenomic surveillance | Limited deployment (est. &lt;5% of high-risk sites) | 95%+ of potential pathogens unmonitored | Slowly improving | CEPI's 100 Days Mission driving investment |
| Clinical surveillance | Days-weeks to detect novel outbreaks | Speed insufficient for engineered pathogens (hours matter) | Stable | Legacy infrastructure constraints |
| Wastewater monitoring | Operational for SARS-CoV-2 in major cities | Limited to known pathogens; ~60% coverage gaps | Improving | Expanding to influenza, RSV |

### Prevention Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Status | Effectiveness |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| DNA synthesis screening | Voluntary, patchy coverage | Microsoft research: AI evades 75%+ |
| Dual-use research oversight | National-level, inconsistent | Variable by jurisdiction |
| Biosafety lab standards | BSL system established | Compliance variable |
| Export controls | Focused on state programs | Less relevant to AI-enabled threats |

### Response Capacity

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has established the "100 Days Mission" aiming to compress vaccine development timelines from pathogen identification to regulatory approval to just 100 days—a dramatic reduction from the 12-18 month historical norm. This relies heavily on platform technologies, particularly mRNA vaccines which demonstrated during COVID-19 that they can proceed from genetic sequence to Phase 1 trials in 63 days (Moderna) and 42 days (Pfizer-BioNTech).

| Capability | Current Status | Target Capability | Improvement Trajectory |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| mRNA vaccine platforms | 42-63 days sequence-to-trial (proven COVID) | &lt;30 days for novel pathogen response | Rapidly improving; trans-amplifying mRNA in development |
| Broad-spectrum antivirals | 2-3 effective families (e.g., molnupiravir) | Pan-coronavirus and pan-influenza coverage | Moderate R&D; limited investment |
| Medical countermeasures stockpiles | 40-60% below pre-COVID baselines (est.) | 120-day supply for 300M people | Slow rebuilding; budget constraints |
| Hospital surge capacity | 15-25% surge tolerance (regional variation) | 200-300% for pandemic response | Declining; staffing crisis |

## What "High Biosecurity" Looks Like

High biosecurity doesn't eliminate all biological risk—it maintains robust capacity across prevention, detection, and response:

### Key Characteristics

1. **Robust screening**: All DNA synthesis covered; AI-resistant detection
2. **Early warning**: Metagenomic surveillance detects novel pathogens within days
3. **Rapid response**: Vaccines and countermeasures in weeks, not years
4. **Coordination**: International information sharing and joint response
5. **Deterrence**: Attribution capability and consequence frameworks

| **Screening evasion** | AI designs sequences that bypass detection | Microsoft: 75%+ evasion rate |
| **Protocol assistance** | AI troubleshoots lab procedures | Documented capability |
| **Combination effects** | AI + cheap synthesis + automation | Converging trends |

### 2025 Capability Assessments

The 2024 U.S. Intelligence Community Annual Threat Assessment explicitly warns: "Rapid advances in dual-use technology, including bioinformatics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and genomic editing, could enable development of novel biological threats." This assessment reflects growing consensus that AI-enabled biology represents a distinct threat category requiring new defensive frameworks.

| Organization | Assessment | Action | Timeframe |
|--------------|------------|--------|-----------|
| <R id="04d39e8bd5d50dd5">OpenAI</R> | Next-gen models expected to hit "high-risk" classification for CBRN capabilities | Elevated biosecurity protocols; pre-deployment screening | 2025-2026 |
| <R id="afe2508ac4caf5ee">Anthropic</R> | Activated ASL-3 for Claude Opus 4 over CBRN concerns | Additional safeguards; restricted access to biology tools | Activated Dec 2024 |

## Why This Parameter Matters

### Consequences of Low Biosecurity

| Domain | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Pandemic risk** | Engineered pathogens could cause mass casualties | Catastrophic |
| **Deterrence failure** | Actors may attempt attacks if defenses are weak | High |
| **Research chilling** | Overreaction could harm beneficial biology | Moderate |
| **Public health trust** | Repeated failures erode cooperation | Moderate |

### The Offense-Defense Balance

Georgetown's analysis characterizes advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology as creating "destabilizing asymmetries" where offensive capabilities increasingly outpace defensive responses. However, this assessment remains contested. While biological design tools and generative AI can develop novel weapons that evade conventional detection, defensive AI systems face fundamental constraints—they must operate within legal frameworks while adversarial actors can break laws freely, creating structural advantage for attackers.

The balance hinges on three critical factors: (1) whether mandatory DNA synthesis screening can close the 75% evasion gap, (2) whether metagenomic surveillance deployment can achieve sufficient coverage (currently &lt;5% of high-risk sites) to provide early warning, and (3) whether mRNA vaccine platforms can compress response times below the 100-day threshold. Expert probability estimates on long-term balance range from 25-45% favoring defense to 15-25% favoring offense, with 30-40% expecting ongoing contestation.

| Factor | Favors Offense | Favors Defense | Magnitude (1-5) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| AI knowledge democratization | ✓ | | 4 - Reduces barrier from expert to intermediate |
| Screening evasion capabilities | ✓ | | 3 - 75% evasion rate with current systems |
| Synthesis cost reduction | ✓ | | 3 - \$1.09/base to &lt;\$1.01/base projected |
| Offense operates outside legal constraints | ✓ | | 5 - Fundamental asymmetry in AI deployment |
| mRNA vaccine platforms (100-day response) | | ✓ | 4 - Proven 42-63 day timelines |
| Metagenomic surveillance | | ✓ | 3 - If deployed at scale (currently limited) |
| Attribution capability | | ✓ | 2 - Forensics improving but imperfect |
| **Net current balance** | **Contested, leaning offense** | **Potentially favorable 2030+ if investments made** | - |

### Biosecurity and Existential Risk

Toby Ord in *The Precipice* estimates **1 in 30** chance of existential catastrophe from engineered pandemics by 2100—second only to AI among anthropogenic risks. AI-enabled bioweapons could:
- Enable non-state actors to cause pandemic-level harm
- Reduce the barrier to attacks that previously required state resources
- Create novel pathogens beyond natural evolution

## Trajectory and Scenarios

### Projected Trajectory

| Timeframe | Key Developments | Biosecurity Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **2025-2026** | Expert-level AI virology; ASL-3 activations | Stress testing defenses |
| **2027-2028** | Potential mandatory DNA screening; improved surveillance | Depends on governance |
| **2029-2030** | AI-designed countermeasures mature | Could shift balance to defense |

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Biosecurity Outcome | Key Indicators (by 2028) | Offense-Defense Balance |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Defense Wins** | 35-45% | Surveillance and vaccines outpace offense | Mandatory DNA screening implemented; metagenomic coverage >40%; &lt;50-day vaccine response proven | Defense +2 |
| **Contested Balance** | 30-40% | Ongoing cat-and-mouse; some incidents | Voluntary screening continues; selective surveillance deployment; 60-90 day vaccine timelines | Neutral |
| **Offense Advantage** | 15-25% | AI-enabled attacks exceed defense capacity | Screening remains voluntary; surveillance &lt;10% coverage; 100+ day responses | Offense +2 |
| **Catastrophic Incident** | 5-10% | Major biological event forces reactive global response | Engineered outbreak with >100K casualties; emergency treaty negotiations | Depends on response |

### Critical Dependencies

| Factor | Importance | Current Status |
|--------|------------|----------------|

| AI model biosecurity evaluation | High | Frontier labs only |
| Metagenomic surveillance deployment | High | Limited |
| International coordination | Very High | Weak |

## Key Debates

### Are AI-Bioweapons Overhyped?

This debate centers on conflicting 2024 evidence. RAND Corporation's January 2024 study concluded that "current artificial intelligence does not meaningfully increase risk of a biological weapons attack" by non-state actors, finding wet lab skills remain the binding constraint. However, RAND President Jason Matheny simultaneously called synthetic biology and AI "grave security challenges for which we are currently unprepared," highlighting divergent interpretations even within the same organization.

**High risk view (35-50% expert probability):**
- AI democratizes dangerous knowledge (GPT-4o3: 94th percentile virologist performance)
- Screening systems catch only 25% of dangerous sequences and AI achieves 75%+ evasion
- Historical non-occurrence reflects lack of capable motivated actors, not impossibility
- Attribution and deterrence fail against non-state actors

**Lower risk view (20-35% expert probability):**
- RAND study found no significant AI uplift for current models
- Wet lab skills remain the bottleneck (equipment access, sterile technique, scale-up)
- Existing information already accessible via scientific literature
- Natural pandemics pose greater near-term risk than engineered ones

**Moderate/uncertain view (30-40% expert probability):**
- Risk is genuine but probability bounds remain wide (5-40% for catastrophic event by 2050)
- Prudent to prepare while avoiding overreaction that chills beneficial biology research
- Defensive investments (surveillance, vaccines) provide value against both natural and engineered threats
- 2025-2027 capability trajectory will provide crucial evidence

### Mandatory vs. Voluntary Screening

**Mandatory screening:**
- Closes gaps in coverage
- Levels competitive playing field
- Enables enforcement

**Voluntary approach:**
- Less bureaucratic burden
- Industry innovation
- Avoids regulatory capture

## Overview

Economic Stability measures the resilience of economic systems to AI-driven changes—encompassing labor market adaptability, income distribution patterns, capital-labor balance, and the smoothness of economic transitions as AI transforms industries.

AI development pace, policy responses, and market adaptation mechanisms all determine whether economic stability strengthens or weakens. Unlike simple employment metrics, this parameter captures the broader capacity of economic systems to absorb technological shocks while maintaining living standards and social cohesion.

This parameter underpins:
- **Social cohesion**: Stable employment and income prevent social unrest
- **Political stability**: Economic disruption fuels populism and instability
- **Investment capacity**: Economic stability enables long-term planning and investment
- **Transition success**: Smooth transitions allow workers to adapt without crisis

This framing enables:
- **Symmetric analysis**: Tracking both destabilizing factors (rapid displacement) and stabilizing factors (new job creation)
- **Early warning**: Detecting economic stress before it becomes crisis
- **Policy design**: Crafting interventions that maintain stability during transition
- **Progress monitoring**: Measuring adaptation capacity over time

## Current State Assessment

### Global Exposure to AI Automation

| Region | Jobs Exposed | High-Risk Share | Complementary Jobs | Key Sectors | Source |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|

*Note: "Exposed" means AI can automate significant portions of job tasks; "High-Risk" means jobs where majority of tasks can be automated; "Complementary" means jobs where AI integration enhances rather than replaces workers. IMF research indicates roughly half of exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity, while the other half face potential displacement.*

### Labor Market Indicators (2024-2025)

| Indicator | Current Value | Pre-AI Baseline (2019) | Trend |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| **US Tech Employment Share** | Declining since Nov 2022 | Stable/growing | Worsening |
| **Young Tech Worker Unemployment** | +3 percentage points | Baseline | Rising |
| **Freelance Writing Gigs** | -42% since 2021 | Baseline | Sharp decline |

### Economic Inequality Trends

| Metric | 2019 | 2024 | Projected 2030 | Assessment | Source |
|--------|------|------|----------------|------------|--------|
| **Top 1% Income Share (US)** | 18.8% | 19.5% | 22-25% | Worsening | <R id="87e546ba6b7733b7">Goldman Sachs</R> |
| **Labor Share of GDP** | 58% | 56% | 50-54% | Declining | [IMF 2024](https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity) |

## What "Healthy Economic Stability" Looks Like

Healthy economic stability during AI transition involves:

1. **Gradual displacement**: Automation pace matches retraining capacity
2. **Broad-based gains**: Productivity benefits shared across income levels
3. **New job creation**: Emerging roles absorb displaced workers
4. **Adaptive institutions**: Education, welfare, and labor systems evolve
5. **Geographic distribution**: Benefits not concentrated in AI hubs

### Stability vs. Disruption Indicators

| Healthy Stability | Dangerous Disruption |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Unemployment rise < 2% annually | Unemployment surge > 5% annually |
| Retraining programs functional | Retraining overwhelmed |
| New job categories emerging | Jobs disappearing faster than emerging |
| Inequality growth < 0.01 Gini/year | Inequality growth > 0.03 Gini/year |
| Wage growth positive | Real wage decline |
| Social mobility maintained | Social mobility declining |

`} />

### Displacement Speed Factors

| Threat | Mechanism | Evidence | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Capability acceleration** | AI advances faster than adaptation | <R id="417f66880659ef93">McKinsey: 57% automatable now</R> | High |
| **Multi-sector simultaneity** | Many industries disrupted at once | Customer service, content, admin hit together | High |
| **Retraining limits** | Workers can't adapt fast enough | <R id="506fe97dbcf61068">Brookings: retraining often fails</R> | High |
| **Geographic concentration** | AI hubs benefit, other areas decline | Tech job concentration in few metros | Medium |

### Capital-Labor Shift

When AI substitutes for human labor across many domains, economic value increasingly flows to capital (AI owners) rather than labor (workers):

| Dynamic | Current State | Trajectory | Risk |
|---------|--------------|------------|------|
| **Labor share of GDP** | 56% (down from 65% in 1970) | Declining | High |
| **Firm concentration** | Top 4 tech firms: \$10T+ market cap | Accelerating | High |
| **Wage-productivity gap** | Widening since 1979 | Accelerating | High |
| **Automation returns** | Accruing primarily to capital owners | Accelerating | High |

### Winner-Take-All Dynamics

| Factor | Mechanism | Current Example |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Network effects** | First-movers capture market | OpenAI/Anthropic/Google dominance |
| **Data advantages** | More users = better AI = more users | ChatGPT's 100M+ users |
| **Talent concentration** | Top labs attract best researchers | &lt;20 orgs can train frontier models |
| **Compute barriers** | \$100M+ training runs exclude most | Only well-funded labs can compete |

---

## Factors That Increase Economic Stability (Supports)

### New Job Creation

| Category | Estimated Jobs | Timeline | Evidence | Confidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|----------|------------|
| **AI development/maintenance** | 2-5M globally | 2025-2030 | Direct industry growth | High |
| **AI training/prompt engineering** | 1-3M | 2024-2027 | Emerging occupation data | Medium |
| **Human-AI collaboration roles** | 10-20M | 2025-2035 | [WEF 2025: net +78M jobs by 2030](https://www.weforum.org/press/2025/01/future-of-jobs-report-2025-78-million-new-job-opportunities-by-2030-but-urgent-upskilling-needed-to-prepare-workforces/) | Medium-Low |
| **Care economy expansion** | 15-30M | 2025-2040 | Aging populations, AI-resistant | Medium |
| **Creative/artisanal premium** | 5-10M | 2025-2035 | "Made by humans" value | Low |
| **Agriculture/delivery workers** | 8-15M | 2025-2030 | [WEF 2025: farmworkers, delivery drivers top growth](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/ai-jobs-replacement-data-careers/) | High |

*Note: WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 projects 170M new roles created globally by 2030, with 92M displaced—net gain of 78M jobs. However, this represents aggregate numbers; geographic and skill mismatches mean displaced workers may not fill new roles.*

### Policy Interventions

| Intervention | Mechanism | Status | Effectiveness | Cost Estimate |
|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Universal Basic Income** | Decouples income from employment | 160+ pilots globally since 1980s | Mixed (reduces poverty, health gains; employment effects unclear) | [\$2-3T annually (US)](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2025/04/29/universal-basic-income-as-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai-1/) |
| **AI Automation Tax** | Tax companies replacing workers with AI | Proposed by Gates (2017), renewed interest 2024-25 | Untested | Potentially \$200-500B annually |
| **Negative Income Tax** | Targeted support for low earners | Proposed in various forms | Theoretical | \$300-600B annually (US) |
| **Transition assistance** | Short-term support during retraining | Germany's Kurzarbeit model | Moderate success | \$50-100B annually |
| **Education reform** | Prepare workers for AI economy | Singapore's SkillsFuture; [WEF: 85% of employers prioritize upskilling](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/future-of-jobs-report-2025-jobs-of-the-future-and-the-skills-you-need-to-get-them/) | Early implementation | \$100-200B annually (global) |
| **Portable benefits** | Benefits not tied to single employer | Gig economy proposals | Limited adoption | \$20-50B annually |

*Note: UBI feasibility depends on AI productivity gains. Research suggests AI capability threshold for economically viable UBI could be reached between 2028 (rapid progress) and mid-century (slow progress). Current US GDP (\$29T) and federal revenue (\$4.9T) insufficient without significant tax reform.*

### Market Adaptation Mechanisms

| Mechanism | How It Stabilizes | Current State |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Wage adjustment** | Lower wages attract hiring | Functioning but slow |
| **Geographic mobility** | Workers move to opportunity | Declining (housing costs) |
| **Entrepreneurship** | Displaced workers start businesses | 30% of new businesses AI-related |
| **Sector shift** | Workers move to growing industries | Possible but friction-heavy |

### Gradual Capability Scaling

If AI capabilities advance gradually rather than rapidly, adaptation mechanisms have time to function:

| Scenario | Displacement Rate | Adaptation Probability | Stability Impact |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Slow capability scaling** | 2-3% workers/year | 70-80% | Maintains stability |
| **Moderate scaling** | 5-7% workers/year | 40-60% | Strains stability |
| **Rapid scaling** | 10%+ workers/year | 20-30% | Threatens stability |

## Why This Parameter Matters

### Consequences of Low Economic Stability

| Domain | Impact | Severity | Historical Parallel |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Social cohesion** | Unrest, protests, crime increases | Critical | Great Depression, Rust Belt decline |
| **Political stability** | Populism, extremism, democratic erosion | Critical | 1930s Europe, 2016 populist wave |
| **Mental health** | Depression, suicide, substance abuse | High | Deindustrialization regions |
| **Investment climate** | Uncertainty reduces long-term investment | High | Emerging market volatility |
| **Human capital** | Skill atrophy during prolonged unemployment | High | Long-term unemployment effects |

### Economic Stability and Existential Risk

Economic stability affects x-risk response through multiple channels:

- **Resource allocation**: Stable economies can fund AI safety research
- **International cooperation**: Economic stress promotes nationalism, reducing cooperation
- **Democratic function**: Economic crisis undermines democratic decision-making
- **Long-term planning**: Instability forces short-term thinking
- **Social trust**: Economic disruption erodes trust needed for collective action

## Key Debates

### This Time Is Different?

**Technological optimists argue:**
- Every major technology has created more jobs than it destroyed
- Human wants are unlimited; new job categories will emerge
- AI augments rather than replaces most workers
- Historical predictions of mass unemployment never materialized

**Disruption pessimists counter:**
- AI affects cognitive work—the category humans retreated to before
- Speed of change unprecedented; adaptation mechanisms may be overwhelmed
- This time the automating technology can learn and improve itself
- Winner-take-all dynamics mean benefits won't be shared

### Policy Response Debate

**Market-focused view:**
- Markets will adjust; government intervention creates distortions
- Education and retraining sufficient response
- Wage flexibility allows labor market clearing
- New jobs will emerge if regulations don't prevent them

**Intervention-focused view:**
- Market adjustment too slow; causes unacceptable suffering
- Retraining insufficient when AI advances faster than learning
- Inequality requires redistribution mechanisms
- Historical transitions (e.g., Industrial Revolution) required policy responses

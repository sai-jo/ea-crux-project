llmSummary: "Epistemic capacity—society's ability to distinguish truth from falsehood—is a foundational parameter currently stressed by the generation-verification asymmetry: AI creates content at pennies per thousand words while verification requires substantial human expertise. With 50%+ of new web articles AI-generated and human deepfake detection at only 55.5% accuracy, both threats (synthetic content flooding, liar's dividend) and supports (content provenance, media literacy) affect this parameter."

## Overview

Epistemic Capacity measures society's collective ability to distinguish truth from falsehood and form shared beliefs about fundamental aspects of reality. As a **key parameter**, it can increase or decrease based on various factors—including AI development and deployment.

This parameter underpins:
- **Democratic deliberation**: Citizens need shared factual foundations to debate policy
- **Scientific progress**: Cumulative knowledge requires reliable verification
- **Collective action**: Coordinating on challenges like climate or AI safety requires consensus
- **Institutional function**: Courts, journalism, and academia depend on evidence evaluation

Understanding epistemic capacity as a parameter (rather than just a "risk of collapse") enables:
- **Symmetric analysis**: Identifying both threats and supports
- **Baseline comparison**: Measuring against historical and optimal levels
- **Intervention targeting**: Focusing resources on effective capacity-building
- **Early warning**: Detecting degradation before critical thresholds

### Human Detection Capability

A <R id="5c1ad27ec9acc6f4">2024 meta-analysis of 56 studies</R> (86,155 participants) found:

| Detection Method | Accuracy | Notes |
|------------------|----------|-------|

| AI detection (real-world) | ~45% | 50% accuracy drop "in-the-wild" |

### Trust Indicators

| Institution | Peak Trust | Current (2024-25) | Trend |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Mass media | 72% (1970s) | 28% | Historic low |
| "No trust at all" in media | &lt;10% | 36-38% | Rising |
| Worry about distinguishing real from fake | -- | 59% globally | Rising |

## What "Healthy Epistemic Capacity" Looks Like

Optimal epistemic capacity is not universal agreement—healthy democracies have genuine disagreements. Instead, it involves:

1. **Shared factual baselines**: Agreement on empirical matters (temperature measurements, election counts, scientific consensus)
2. **Functional verification**: Ability to check claims when stakes are high
3. **Calibrated skepticism**: Appropriate doubt without paralysis
4. **Cross-cutting trust**: Some trusted sources across partisan lines
5. **Error correction**: Mechanisms to identify and correct falsehoods

### Historical Baseline

Pre-AI information environments had:
- Clear distinctions between fabricated content (cartoons, labeled propaganda) and documentation (news photos, official records)
- Verification capacity roughly matched generation capacity
- Media trust levels of 60-70%
- Shared reference points across political identities

### AI-Driven Threats

| Threat | Mechanism | Current Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Content flooding** | AI generates content faster than verification can scale | 50%+ of new content AI-generated |
| **Liar's dividend** | Possibility of fakes undermines trust in all evidence | Politicians successfully deny real scandals |
| **Personalized realities** | AI creates unique information environments per user | Echo chambers becoming "reality chambers" |
| **Deepfake sophistication** | Synthetic media approaches photorealism | Voice cloning needs only minutes of audio |
| **Detection arms race** | Generation advances faster than detection | Lab detection doesn't transfer to real-world |

### The Liar's Dividend in Practice

The "liar's dividend" (<R id="5494083a1717fed7">Chesney & Citron</R>) describes how the mere *possibility* of fabricated evidence undermines trust in *all* evidence.

Real examples:
- Tesla lawyers <R id="094219a46adde1cf">argued Elon Musk's past remarks could be deepfakes</R>
- Indian politician claimed embarrassing audio was AI-generated (researchers confirmed authentic)
- Israel-Gaza conflict: both sides accused each other of AI-generated evidence

A <R id="c75d8df0bbf5a94d">2024 study (APSR)</R> found politicians who claimed real scandals were misinformation received support boosts across partisan subgroups.

### Non-AI Threats

- **Institutional failures**: Genuine misconduct that justifies reduced trust
- **Economic incentives**: Engagement-based algorithms reward compelling over accurate
- **Polarization**: Partisan media creating incompatible information environments
- **Attention scarcity**: Too much content to verify, leading to shortcuts

## Why This Parameter Matters

### Consequences of Low Epistemic Capacity

| Domain | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Elections** | Contested results, reduced participation, violence | Critical |
| **Public health** | Pandemic response failure, vaccine hesitancy | High |
| **Climate action** | Policy paralysis from disputed evidence | High |
| **Scientific progress** | Fabricated research, replication crisis | Moderate-High |
| **Courts/law** | Evidence reliability questioned | High |
| **International cooperation** | Treaty verification becomes impossible | Critical |

### Epistemic Capacity and Existential Risk

Low epistemic capacity directly undermines humanity's ability to address existential risks:

- **Pandemic preparedness** requires trusted public health communication
- **Climate response** requires accepted scientific consensus
- **Nuclear security** requires reliable verification regimes

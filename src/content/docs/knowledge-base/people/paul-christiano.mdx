## Overview

Paul Christiano is one of the most influential researchers in AI alignment, known for developing concrete, empirically testable approaches to the [alignment problem](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/). With a PhD in theoretical computer science from UC Berkeley, he has worked at OpenAI, DeepMind, and founded the [Alignment Research Center (ARC)](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/arc/).

Christiano pioneered the "prosaic alignment" approach—aligning AI without requiring exotic theoretical breakthroughs. His current risk assessment places ~10-20% probability on existential risk from AI this century, with AGI arrival in the 2030s-2040s. His work has directly influenced alignment research programs at major labs including [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/), [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/), and [DeepMind](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/deepmind/).

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Christiano's Assessment | Evidence/Reasoning | Comparison to Field |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| P(doom) | ~10-20% | Alignment tractable but challenging | Moderate (vs 50%+ doomers, &lt;5% optimists) |
| AGI Timeline | 2030s-2040s | Gradual capability increase | Mainstream range |
| Alignment Difficulty | Hard but tractable | Iterative progress possible | More optimistic than [MIRI](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/miri/) |
| Coordination Feasibility | Moderately optimistic | Labs have incentives to cooperate | More optimistic than average |

## Key Technical Contributions

### Iterated Amplification and Distillation (IDA)

Published in <R id="f0980ca7010a4a44">"Supervising strong learners by amplifying weak experts"</R> (2018):

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Human + AI Collaboration | Human overseer works with AI assistant on complex tasks | Tested at scale by <R id="664f6ab2e2488b0d">OpenAI</R> |
| Distillation | Extract human+AI behavior into standalone AI system | Standard ML technique |
| Iteration | Repeat process with increasingly capable systems | Theoretical framework |
| Bootstrapping | Build aligned AGI from aligned weak systems | Core theoretical hope |

**Key insight**: If we can align a weak system and use it to help align slightly stronger systems, we can bootstrap to aligned AGI without solving the full problem directly.

### AI Safety via Debate

Co-developed with <R id="367c57adf0c2bc75">Geoffrey Irving</R> at DeepMind in <R id="61da2f8e311a2bbf">"AI safety via debate"</R> (2018):

| Mechanism | Implementation | Results |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Adversarial Training | Two AIs argue for different positions | Deployed at <R id="1000c5dea784ef64">Anthropic</R> |
| Human Judgment | Human evaluates which argument is more convincing | Scales human oversight capability |
| Truth Discovery | Debate incentivizes finding flaws in opponent arguments | Mixed empirical results |
| Scalability | Works even when AIs are smarter than humans | Theoretical hope |

### Scalable Oversight Framework

Christiano's broader research program on supervising superhuman AI:

| Problem | Proposed Solution | Current Status |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Task too complex for direct evaluation | Process-based feedback vs outcome evaluation | <R id="a0406a8b2e9bffe0">Implemented at OpenAI</R> |
| AI reasoning opaque to humans | Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) | Active research area |
| Deceptive alignment | Recursive reward modeling | Early stage research |
| Capability-alignment gap | Assistance games framework | Theoretical foundation |

## Intellectual Evolution and Current Views

### Early Period (2016-2019)

- **Higher optimism**: Alignment seemed more tractable
- **IDA focus**: Believed iterative amplification could solve core problems  
- **Less doom**: Lower estimates of catastrophic risk

### Current Period (2020-Present)

| Shift | From | To | Evidence |
|-------|------|----|---------| 
| Risk assessment | ~5% P(doom) | ~10-20% P(doom) | <R id="6807a8a8f2fd23f3">"What failure looks like"</R> |
| Research focus | IDA/Debate | Eliciting Latent Knowledge | <R id="e6ff505f606f86cf">ARC's ELK report</R> |
| Governance views | Lab-focused | Broader coordination | Recent policy writings |
| Timelines | Longer | Shorter (2030s-2040s) | Following capability advances |

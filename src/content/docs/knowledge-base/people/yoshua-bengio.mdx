## Overview

Yoshua Bengio is one of the three "Godfathers of AI" who won the 2018 Turing Award alongside [Geoffrey Hinton](/knowledge-base/people/geoffrey-hinton/) and Yann LeCun for foundational work in deep learning. His transformation from pure capabilities researcher to AI safety advocate represents one of the most significant shifts in the field, bringing immense credibility to [AI risk](/knowledge-base/risks/) concerns.

As Scientific Director of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), one of the world's largest AI research institutes, Bengio has redirected substantial resources toward [AI safety research](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/) since 2020. His co-signing of the 2023 AI extinction risk statement and subsequent policy advocacy have positioned him as a bridge between the technical AI community and policymakers concerned about existential risks.

  ]}
/>

### Core Safety Concerns

**Power Concentration Risks:**
- AI capabilities could concentrate in few hands
- Democratic institutions may be undermined
- Economic inequality could dramatically increase

**Technical Control Problems:**
- [Alignment difficulty](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/) as systems become more capable
- [Emergent capabilities](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/emergent-capabilities/) that are difficult to predict

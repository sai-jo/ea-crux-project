## Overview

Catastrophic Misuse refers to scenarios where humans intentionally use AI systems to cause mass harm. Unlike AI Takeover (where the AI itself is the threat), misuse risks arise from human intentions enabled by AI capabilities.

The core concern: as AI systems become more capable, they lower the barriers to causing mass harm. Tasks that previously required large organizations, rare expertise, or expensive equipment may become accessible to small groups or individuals.

### The Uplift Problem

AI doesn't need to be fully autonomous to be dangerous—it just needs to provide significant "uplift" to malicious actors:

| Domain | Pre-AI Barrier | AI Uplift | Concern Level |
|--------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Bioweapons** | PhD-level expertise, lab access | Could guide synthesis, predict mutations | Very High |
| **Cyberattacks** | Skilled hackers, time | Automates vulnerability finding, exploit writing | High |
| **Disinformation** | Production costs, distribution | Generates content at scale, targets individuals | Medium-High |
| **CBRN** | Specialized knowledge | Lowers knowledge barriers | Medium |

---

## Major Pathways

### 1. Biological Weapons

**Current assessment**: Most concerning near-term pathway

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| LLM uplift for synthesis | Demonstrated in red-team exercises |
| Dual-use biology knowledge | Openly published |
| Lab access trend | Democratizing (community bio labs) |
| Detection capability | Lagging behind creation capability |

**Estimates**:
- Biosecurity researchers estimate AI could provide 2-10x uplift for non-expert actors
- RAND/OpenAI studies found LLMs provide "mild uplift" for bioweapon planning
- Major concern: AI-assisted design of novel pathogens

### 2. Cyber Operations

**Capability progression**:

| Phase | Timeline | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Automated phishing | Now | Scale of social engineering attacks |
| Vulnerability discovery | 2024-2025 | Faster zero-day finding |
| Autonomous exploitation | 2025-2027? | Attack without human involvement |
| Adaptive attacks | 2027+? | AI vs AI cyber conflict |

**Critical infrastructure risks**:
- Power grids
- Financial systems
- Healthcare networks
- Transportation

### 3. Autonomous Weapons

**Concerns by actor type**:

| Actor | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| Major powers | Arms race dynamics, lowered threshold for conflict |
| Authoritarian states | Domestic repression without human reluctance |
| Non-state actors | Asymmetric warfare capability |
| Criminal groups | Assassination, intimidation |

### 4. Mass Surveillance & Control

**Not catastrophic in casualties, but potentially civilizationally transformative**:

- AI-powered social credit systems
- Predictive policing at scale
- Automated censorship and propaganda
- Elimination of privacy

## Risk Estimates

| Source | Estimate | Scope |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Toby Ord | 2% | "Dystopian" scenarios |
| Hendrycks et al. | "Major" category | One of four AI catastrophe types |
| Expert surveys | Varies widely | Depends on timeframe and scenario |

**Key uncertainty**: How much does AI actually enable vs. being one of many tools?

---

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Relationship | Direction |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| [Threat Environment](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/threat-environment/) | Determines who wants to cause harm | Higher threat → Higher risk |
| Model Access Regime | Controls who can use capable models | More open → Higher risk |
| Governance Effectiveness | Ability to prevent/respond | Lower → Higher risk |
| [Safety-Capability Gap](/knowledge-base/parameters/safety-capability-gap/) | Time pressure on defense | Wider → Higher risk |

---

## What Would Reduce This Risk?

### Technical Approaches

| Intervention | Mechanism |
|--------------|-----------|
| [Red teaming](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/red-teaming/) | Identify dangerous capabilities before deployment |
| Capability filtering | Prevent models from helping with harm |
| Biosecurity-specific safeguards | Extra guardrails for biology |
| Attribution systems | Make misuse traceable |

### Governance Approaches

| Intervention | Mechanism |
|--------------|-----------|
| Model access controls | Limit who can use most capable models |
| Know-your-customer for AI | Accountability for API access |
| [Export controls](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/export-controls/) | Prevent adversary access |
| International cooperation | Coordinate on dual-use restrictions |

### Domain-Specific Defenses

| Domain | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Bio | Metagenomic surveillance, DNA synthesis screening |
| Cyber | AI-powered defense, critical infrastructure hardening |
| Autonomous weapons | International treaties, technical safeguards |
| Surveillance | Privacy-preserving tech, legal protections |

## Cruxes and Disagreements

### Why Some Think This Is High Priority

1. **Near-term**: Unlike takeover, misuse risks exist with current systems
2. **Tractable**: Technical safeguards and governance can help
3. **Clear harm**: Doesn't require speculative AI capabilities
4. **Historical precedent**: Dual-use tech has been misused before

### Why Some Think This Is Lower Priority

1. **Defense advances too**: AI also helps detect and prevent attacks
2. **Attribution will improve**: Hard to use anonymously at scale
3. **Marginal vs. decisive**: AI may not be the binding constraint
4. **Relative to takeover**: If takeover is likely, misuse is a smaller concern
5. **Offense-defense balance**: Unclear which side AI favors

### Open Questions

- How much does AI actually "uplift" vs. being one factor among many?
- Can safety training reliably prevent misuse without crippling usefulness?
- Do open-source models make restrictions futile?
- How do we balance access benefits against misuse risks?

## Comparison with AI Takeover

| Dimension | Catastrophic Misuse | AI Takeover |
|-----------|--------------------| ------------|
| **Threat actor** | Humans | AI system |
| **AI role** | Tool/enabler | Primary agent |
| **Timeline** | Near-term | Medium-to-long term |
| **Tractability** | Possibly higher | Possibly lower |
| **Prevention** | Governance, safeguards | Alignment |
| **Detection** | Human intentions | AI intentions |

---

## Historical Analogies

| Technology | Misuse Pattern | Relevance to AI |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Nuclear | State programs, some proliferation | Centralized development, hard to acquire |
| Biological | State programs, occasional terrorism | Knowledge more important than materials |
| Internet | Cybercrime, surveillance | Rapid scaling, attribution problems |
| Social media | Disinformation, radicalization | Dual-use, democratized access |

The biological analogy is particularly concerning because, like AI assistance for biology, the key constraint is knowledge rather than physical materials.

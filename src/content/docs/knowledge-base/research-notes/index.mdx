## Purpose

This section contains **internal working documents**—brainstorms, open questions, and rough thinking that informs how we develop the knowledge base. Unlike the [Methodology](/knowledge-base/methodology/) section (which explains and justifies our framework to readers), these pages are:

- **Rough drafts**, not polished content
- **Questions**, not answers
- **Explorations**, not conclusions
- **For internal use**, not external consumption

Think of this as our "lab notebook" for framework development.

## Current Research Questions

### Framework Structure

| Question | Status | Page |
|----------|--------|------|
| What should sit between Parameters and Outcomes? | **Resolved** | [Critical Outcomes](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/) |
| How should we handle parameters that aren't "higher is better"? | Open | — |
| Should aggregates be formally weighted? | Open | [Prioritization Framework](/knowledge-base/research-notes/prioritization-framework/) |

### Taxonomy Questions

| Question | Status | Page |
|----------|--------|------|
| What's the right taxonomy of failure modes? | **Resolved** | [Critical Outcomes](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/) |
| How do our risks map to Carlsmith's decomposition? | Open | — |
| Should we distinguish decisive vs. accumulative risks? | Open | — |

## How to Use This Section

**Reading**: Treat everything here as provisional. If something seems wrong or half-baked, it probably is—these are working documents.

**Contributing**: Add new brainstorm pages for open questions. Use headers like "Open Questions", "Candidate Answers", "Arguments For/Against" to structure thinking.

**Graduating content**: When a research note matures into something we're confident about, it should move to [Methodology](/knowledge-base/methodology/) or inform changes to the main knowledge base.

## Pages

| Page | Focus |
|------|-------|
| [Intermediate Layer](/knowledge-base/research-notes/intermediate-layer/) | What sits between parameters and outcomes? Brainstorming "critical issues" / failure modes taxonomy |
| [Coverage Gaps](/knowledge-base/research-notes/coverage-gaps/) | What topics, perspectives, and content types are missing from the KB? |
| [Prioritization Framework](/knowledge-base/research-notes/prioritization-framework/) | How do we decide what to work on? Content, interventions, research priorities |
| [Worldview Sensitivity](/knowledge-base/research-notes/worldview-sensitivity/) | How do conclusions change under different worldviews? What's robust vs. fragile? |
| [Critical Issues (Brainstorm)](/knowledge-base/research-notes/critical-issues-brainstorm/) | Alternative failure mode taxonomy (superseded by Critical Outcomes) |

This document catalogs inconsistencies between the canonical AI Transition Model (as defined in `parameter-graph.yaml` and displayed at [/parameter-graph/](/parameter-graph/)) and the various Mermaid diagrams and terminology used throughout the knowledge base.

**211 files** contain Mermaid diagrams. Many use different ontologies, terminology, and structural assumptions than the canonical model.

---

## Canonical Model (Source of Truth)

The canonical model is defined in `src/data/parameter-graph.yaml` and rendered at `/parameter-graph/`.

### Three-Layer Structure

```
ROOT FACTORS (5)
├── Misalignment Potential
├── AI Capabilities
├── Civilizational Competence
├── Transition Turbulence
└── Misuse Potential

    ↓ (influences)

STRUCTURAL SCENARIOS (3)
├── AI Takeover
├── Human-Caused Catastrophe
└── Long-term Lock-in

    ↓ (leads to)

ULTIMATE OUTCOMES (2)
├── Existential Catastrophe
└── Long-term Trajectory
```

### Canonical Terminology

| Layer | Terms Used | Definition |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Ultimate Outcomes | **Existential Catastrophe** | Civilization-ending or irreversible harm |
| Ultimate Outcomes | **Long-term Trajectory** | Quality of post-transition future |
| Structural Scenarios | AI Takeover, Human-Caused Catastrophe, Long-term Lock-in | Intermediate pathways |
| Root Factors | 5 named factors | Underlying variables |

---

## Critical Terminology Conflicts

### Ultimate Outcomes: Two Different Naming Systems

**The most significant discrepancy**: Pages use TWO different naming systems for the same outcomes.

| Canonical (parameter-graph.yaml) | Alternative (used in many pages) | Pages Using Alternative |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Existential Catastrophe** | **Acute Risk** | transition-turbulence/index.mdx, outcomes/index.mdx |
| **Long-term Trajectory** | **Long-run Value** | transition-turbulence/index.mdx |

**Example from transition-turbulence/index.mdx**:
```yaml
subgraph Effects["Effects on Ultimate Outcomes"]
    ACUTE[Acute Risk]       # ← Should be "Existential Catastrophe"
    LONGRUN[Long-run Value]  # ← Should be "Long-term Trajectory"
end
```

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "Existential Catastrophe" and "Long-term Trajectory" everywhere.

### Parameter URL Status

Parameter URLs in `parameter-graph.yaml` have been updated to the new flattened structure at `/parameters/`. Individual pages may still contain old nested URLs that need updating.

## Individual Page Diagrams vs. Canonical Model

### Transition Turbulence Page

**Location**: [/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/)

**Diagram Structure** (differs from canonical):
```
Turbulence Drivers
├── Rapid Capability Growth
├── Economic Displacement
├── Racing Dynamics
├── Coordination Failures
    ↓
How Turbulence Manifests
├── Economic Instability
├── Political Instability
├── Social Fragmentation
├── Institutional Stress
    ↓
Transition Turbulence (factor)
    ↓
Effects on Ultimate Outcomes
├── Acute Risk          ← Uses alternative term
└── Long-run Value      ← Uses alternative term
```

**Issues**:
1. Uses "Acute Risk" instead of "Existential Catastrophe"
2. Uses "Long-run Value" instead of "Long-term Trajectory"
3. Introduces concepts not in canonical model (Economic Instability, Political Instability, etc.)
4. No mention of Structural Scenarios layer

### Misalignment Potential Page

**Location**: [/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/misalignment-potential/)

**Diagram Structure**:
```
Misalignment Potential Components
├── Interpretability Coverage
├── Safety-Capability Gap
├── Safety Culture Strength
├── Human Oversight Quality
    ↓ (all feed into)
Alignment Robustness
    ↓
Misalignment Potential
    ↓
Existential Catastrophe ↑
```

**Issues**:
1. Shows only ONE ultimate outcome (Existential Catastrophe), not both
2. Missing intermediate Structural Scenarios layer (should show AI Takeover)
3. Canonical model shows Misalignment Potential → AI Takeover → Existential Catastrophe

### Rapid AI Takeover Page

**Location**: [/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/rapid/](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/rapid/)

**Diagram Structure** (completely different ontology):
```
Enabling Conditions
├── Sufficient Capabilities
├── Misaligned Goals
├── Opportunity/Trigger
    ↓
Takeover Mechanisms
├── Recursive Self-Improvement
├── Cyber Infrastructure Control
├── Economic/Financial Leverage
├── Human Manipulation
├── Physical World Control
    ↓
Result
└── Human Disempowerment
```

**Issues**:
1. Uses "Human Disempowerment" as outcome (not in canonical model)
2. Entirely mechanistic model, not factor-scenario-outcome structure
3. No reference to Ultimate Outcomes or Structural Scenarios

**Note**: This mechanistic approach is arguably appropriate for explaining HOW a scenario happens, but should explicitly link back to the canonical structure.

## Cross-Section Concept Duplication

The same concepts appear in multiple sections with different framing:

### Racing/Competition

| Location | Concept Name | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `/risks/structural/racing-dynamics.mdx` | Racing Dynamics | Risk |
| `/ai-transition-model/parameters/racing-intensity.mdx` | Racing Intensity | Parameter |
| Transition Turbulence diagram | Racing Dynamics | Driver |

**Issue**: Is racing a risk, a parameter, or a driver? The ontology should clarify.

### Economic Disruption

| Location | Concept Name | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `/risks/structural/economic-disruption.mdx` | Economic Disruption | Risk |
| `/ai-transition-model/parameters/economic-stability.mdx` | Economic Stability | Parameter |
| Transition Turbulence diagram | Economic Instability | Manifestation |
| Transition Turbulence diagram | Economic Displacement | Driver |

**Issue**: Four related concepts with different names and framings.

### Trust

| Location | Concept Name | Framing |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `/risks/epistemic/trust-decline.mdx` | Trust Decline | Risk (negative) |
| `/ai-transition-model/parameters/societal-trust.mdx` | Societal Trust | Parameter (neutral) |

### Deceptive Alignment vs. Scheming

| Location | Concept | Relationship |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment.mdx` | Deceptive Alignment | Risk |
| `/risks/accident/scheming.mdx` | Scheming | Risk |
| `/models/risk-models/deceptive-alignment-decomposition.mdx` | Deceptive Alignment Decomposition | Model |
| `/models/risk-models/scheming-likelihood-model.mdx` | Scheming Likelihood Model | Model |

**Issue**: Scheming.mdx says it's "closely related to deceptive alignment" but they're separate pages. Should clarify relationship.

---

## Section-Specific Issues

### Structural Scenarios

The [Scenarios Index](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/scenarios/) correctly defines 3 structural scenarios matching the canonical model. However, scenario sub-pages (rapid.mdx, gradual.mdx, etc.) have detailed mechanistic diagrams but don't always connect back to:
- The Root Factors that increase their probability
- The Ultimate Outcomes they produce

### Risk Pages

Risk pages in `/knowledge-base/risks/` often have self-contained Mermaid diagrams showing mechanisms, warning signs, and cascades. These generally don't reference the AI Transition Model structure.

### Models Section

The `/knowledge-base/models/` section contains 78 model pages, each with its own Mermaid diagram and conceptual structure. Most are standalone analytical models.

**Examples of diverse structures**:

| Model | Structure Used |
|-------|---------------|
| carlsmith-six-premises | 6-premise conditional chain |
| deceptive-alignment-decomposition | Probability tree |
| racing-dynamics-impact | System dynamics (stocks/flows) |
| trust-cascade-model | Cascade/feedback diagram |

**Note**: This diversity is appropriate for models as analytical tools, but they should reference where they fit in the ATM.

### Responses Section

After recent work, ~40 response pages have "AI Transition Model Context" sections using EntityLink to canonical parameters. Some responses still lack these sections.

## Prioritized Fixes

### Critical (Breaks navigation/understanding)

| Issue | Files | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **"Acute Risk" vs "Existential Catastrophe"** | transition-turbulence/index.mdx, outcomes/index.mdx | Standardize on "Existential Catastrophe" |
| **"Long-run Value" vs "Long-term Trajectory"** | transition-turbulence/index.mdx | Standardize on "Long-term Trajectory" |

### High Priority (Conceptual inconsistency)

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Misalignment Potential diagram skips Scenarios layer | Misleading about model structure | Add AI Takeover intermediate |
| Rapid AI Takeover uses "Human Disempowerment" | Different outcome term | Connect to Existential Catastrophe |
| Concept duplication (Racing x4, Economic x4) | Confusing | Create explicit equivalence mappings |

### Medium Priority (Polish)

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Risk pages don't reference ATM | Missing context | Add ATM Context sections |
| Model pages are standalone | Fragmented knowledge | Add "Where This Fits" sections |
| Response pages partial coverage | Incomplete integration | Continue ATM Context rollout |

### Lower Priority (Design decisions)

| Issue | Options |
|-------|---------|
| Mechanistic diagrams vs. structural diagrams | Keep both, add explicit labels |
| Parameter-as-risk vs. risk-as-parameter | Document the dual framing explicitly |
| 3-layer vs. richer intermediate structures | Consider adding optional 4th layer |

---

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues
1. Find/replace "Acute Risk" → "Existential Catastrophe" in all Mermaid diagrams
2. Find/replace "Long-run Value" → "Long-term Trajectory" in all Mermaid diagrams

### Phase 2: Standardize Factor Pages
1. Update Misalignment Potential diagram to show Scenarios layer
2. Update Transition Turbulence diagram terminology
3. Update other factor pages to consistent structure

### Phase 3: Connect Scenario Pages
1. Add Root Factor context to scenario sub-pages
2. Add Ultimate Outcome links to scenario sub-pages
3. Ensure mechanistic diagrams are labeled as "How This Happens" (not the ontology)

### Phase 4: Audit and Document
1. Create explicit mapping table: Risk concept ↔ Parameter concept
2. Add "Canonical Position" field to relevant pages
3. Document when/why mechanistic diagrams differ from structural model

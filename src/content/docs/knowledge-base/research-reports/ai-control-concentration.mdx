## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Corporate concentration** | 3-5 labs control frontier | Few decision-makers |
| **Geographic concentration** | US + China dominate | Limited diversity |
| **Compute concentration** | Top 5 cloud providers: 90%+ | Infrastructure choke point |
| **Decision concentration** | Small executive teams | Limited accountability |
| **Trend** | Concentration increasing | Worsening |

## Research Summary

Control over AI systems—who can develop, deploy, and direct powerful AI—is highly concentrated along multiple dimensions. A handful of companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta) control virtually all frontier model development. Two countries (United States and China) dominate global AI capability. A few cloud providers control most AI compute infrastructure. And within these organizations, small groups of executives make decisions affecting billions.

This concentration has both risks and potential benefits. On the risk side: concentrated control means few actors' values are embedded in systems affecting everyone, single points of failure could have catastrophic effects, and power could be abused for private benefit. On the potential benefit side: fewer actors may be easier to coordinate and regulate, and concentrated resources enable safety investment that distributed development might not.

The trend is toward increasing concentration. Capital requirements for frontier models are rising rapidly ($1B+ per training run), creating insurmountable barriers for most actors. Talent pools are limited and increasingly captured by major labs. And first-mover advantages compound, making leaders harder to challenge.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Control vs Ownership">
Control is broader than ownership. It includes who can train frontier models, who sets deployment policies, who decides on safety measures, and who influences AI governance. Control concentration means these decisions are made by few.
</Aside>

### Dimensions of Control

| Dimension | Description | Concentration Level |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Development** | Who can build frontier AI | Very High |
| **Deployment** | Who decides on releases | Very High |
| **Infrastructure** | Who provides compute | High |
| **Governance** | Who makes rules | High |
| **Research direction** | Who sets priorities | High |

### Control Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Control Mechanism | Current Influence |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **AI labs** | Build and deploy models | Very High |
| **Cloud providers** | Provide compute | High |
| **Governments** | Regulate, fund | Moderate but growing |
| **Researchers** | Technical direction | Moderate |
| **Civil society** | Advocacy, norms | Low |
| **General public** | Democratic pressure | Low |

## Key Findings

### Corporate Concentration

| Company | Estimated Frontier Market Share | Control Mechanisms |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI/Microsoft** | 35-40% | Models, API, Azure |
| **Google DeepMind** | 25-30% | Models, Cloud, Search |
| **Anthropic** | 15-20% | Models, API |
| **Meta** | 10-15% | Open weights |
| **Others** | \<10% | Fragmented |

<Aside type="caution" title="Highly Concentrated">
The top 3-4 organizations control ~90% of frontier AI capability. This is higher concentration than most other technology sectors.
</Aside>

### Geographic Concentration

| Country | Share of Frontier Capability | Trend |
|---------|----------------------------|-------|
| **United States** | 60-70% | Stable-Growing |
| **China** | 20-25% | Growing |
| **EU** | 3-5% | Limited |
| **UK** | 2-3% | Stable |
| **Others** | \<5% | Fragmented |

### Compute Infrastructure

| Provider | AI Compute Share | AI Lab Partnerships |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Microsoft Azure** | 30%+ | OpenAI exclusive |
| **Amazon AWS** | 25%+ | Anthropic |
| **Google Cloud** | 20%+ | In-house DeepMind |
| **NVIDIA** | 80%+ of GPUs | All labs |
| **TSMC** | 90%+ advanced chips | All providers |

### Decision-Making Concentration

| Organization | Key Decision-Makers | Board Influence |
|--------------|--------------------| ----------------|
| **OpenAI** | ~5-10 executives | Contested |
| **Anthropic** | ~5 executives | Trust structure |
| **DeepMind** | Small leadership + Alphabet | Parent company |
| **Meta AI** | Zuckerberg + small team | Zuckerberg control |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Driving Concentration

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Capital requirements** | $1B+ per frontier model | Increasing |
| **Talent scarcity** | Limited top researchers | Slowly improving |
| **Data advantages** | Proprietary datasets | Persistent |
| **First-mover effects** | Leaders attract resources | Strong |
| **Network effects** | APIs create lock-in | Increasing |

### Factors That Could Reduce Concentration

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Open weights** | Distribute capabilities | Active but controversial |
| **Efficiency gains** | Lower compute needs | Ongoing |
| **Government investment** | Public alternatives | Limited |
| **Antitrust** | Break up concentrations | Minimal action |
| **New entrants** | Competition | High barriers |

## Risks from Concentration

### Power Abuse Risks

| Risk | Mechanism | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Value imposition** | Few actors' values in AI | Diverse development |
| **Rent extraction** | Monopoly pricing | Competition, regulation |
| **Political influence** | Concentrated power | Governance oversight |
| **Coordination failure** | Don't represent humanity | Democratic input |

### Single Point of Failure Risks

| Risk | Mechanism | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Lab failure** | If leaders get safety wrong | Diversity |
| **Technical failure** | Concentrated systems fail together | Redundancy |
| **Capture** | Concentrated easier to capture | Distribution |
| **Compromise** | Security breach affects all | Isolation |

<Aside type="note" title="The Concentration Dilemma">
Concentration may be necessary for safety (resources, coordination) but also creates risks (power abuse, single failure). The question is whether benefits outweigh risks—which depends on whether concentrated actors behave well.
</Aside>

## Governance Implications

### Accountability Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Democratic deficit** | Public has no voice | Persistent |
| **Information asymmetry** | Public can't assess | Severe |
| **Regulatory capture** | Labs influence rules | Risk |
| **Global reach** | National regulation limited | Structural |

### Policy Options

| Option | Description | Feasibility |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Antitrust** | Break up concentrations | Difficult |
| **Public alternatives** | Government AI development | Some interest |
| **Mandate distribution** | Required open weights | Controversial |
| **Enhanced oversight** | Strict regulation of concentrated power | Growing |

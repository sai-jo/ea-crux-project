## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Regulatory lag** | 2-5 year gap behind capabilities | Governance often reactive |
| **Limited coverage** | 6 countries with binding rules | Most AI development unregulated |
| **EU leadership** | AI Act fully effective 2026 | Sets global benchmark |
| **US fragmentation** | 10+ agencies with AI oversight | No unified framework |
| **International gaps** | No binding treaties | Coordination insufficient |

## Research Summary

AI governance encompasses the rules, norms, institutions, and practices that shape AI development and deployment. Despite the rapid advancement of AI capabilities since 2022, governance frameworks have struggled to keep pace. The EU AI Act, adopted in 2024, represents the most comprehensive binding regulation globally, establishing risk-based requirements for AI systems. However, it won't be fully effective until 2026, by which time AI capabilities may have advanced significantly further.

The United States lacks a unified federal AI framework, instead relying on a patchwork of executive orders, agency guidance, and voluntary commitments. The October 2023 Executive Order on AI Safety established some requirements for frontier models but lacks enforcement mechanisms and may not survive administration changes. China has implemented binding regulations focused on specific applications (recommender systems, generative AI) but maintains state direction over AI development priorities.

International governance remains nascent. The Bletchley Declaration (November 2023) and Seoul Summit (May 2024) established voluntary frameworks and the International AI Safety Network, but binding international agreements remain elusive. The pace of capability advancement continues to outstrip governance capacity, creating persistent gaps between what AI systems can do and what rules govern their use.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="The Governance Challenge">
AI governance must balance enabling beneficial innovation against preventing harm, while keeping pace with rapidly evolving technology and addressing global coordination problems.
</Aside>

### Historical Evolution

| Period | Governance Focus | Key Developments |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **2016-2019** | Ethical principles | Asilomar AI Principles, OECD guidelines |
| **2019-2022** | Soft law | National AI strategies, voluntary commitments |
| **2022-2024** | Hard law emergence | EU AI Act, China regulations, US EO |
| **2024-present** | Implementation | Enforcement begins, international coordination |

### Governance Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Technical standards** | Safety requirements, testing protocols |
| **Legal frameworks** | Binding regulations, liability rules |
| **Industry self-governance** | Voluntary commitments, best practices |
| **International coordination** | Treaties, mutual recognition |
| **Institutional capacity** | Regulatory expertise and resources |

## Key Findings

### National Regulatory Frameworks

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Status | Scope |
|--------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **EU** | AI Act | Effective Aug 2024-2026 | Risk-based, comprehensive |
| **China** | Multiple regulations | Effective | Application-specific |
| **UK** | Pro-innovation approach | Framework | Sector-based, light touch |
| **US** | Executive Order + agency rules | Fragmented | Limited binding requirements |
| **Canada** | AIDA (proposed) | Pending | Risk-based |
| **Japan** | Guidelines | Voluntary | Principles-based |

<Aside type="caution" title="Enforcement Gap">
Even where regulations exist, enforcement capacity is limited. The EU AI Office has ~140 staff to oversee a market of 450 million people. The US has no dedicated AI regulator.
</Aside>

### EU AI Act Structure

| Risk Level | Requirements | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Unacceptable** | Prohibited | Social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance |
| **High** | Strict compliance | Critical infrastructure, employment, law enforcement |
| **Limited** | Transparency | Chatbots, emotion recognition |
| **Minimal** | None | Most AI applications |

### Frontier Model Governance

| Approach | Actors | Mechanism |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Responsible Scaling** | Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind | Self-imposed capability thresholds |
| **Safety evaluations** | Labs + third parties | Pre-deployment testing |
| **Compute thresholds** | EU AI Act, US EO | Training compute triggers requirements |
| **Licensing** | Proposed in EU | May require approval for frontier models |

### International Coordination

| Initiative | Year | Participants | Status |
|------------|------|--------------|--------|
| **Bletchley Declaration** | 2023 | 28 countries | Voluntary principles |
| **Seoul Declaration** | 2024 | 16 companies, 27 countries | Safety commitments |
| **AI Safety Institutes** | 2023-2024 | US, UK, Japan, Singapore | National bodies |
| **Frontier Model Forum** | 2023 | Major labs | Industry coordination |
| **GPAI** | 2020 | 29 countries | Research coordination |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Governance Effectiveness

| Factor | Mechanism | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Capability pace** | Technology outruns rules | High |
| **Technical complexity** | Regulators lack expertise | High |
| **Industry lobbying** | Weakens proposed rules | Medium-High |
| **Jurisdictional arbitrage** | Development moves to lenient jurisdictions | Medium |
| **Coordination failures** | Countries can't agree | High |

### Factors That Could Improve Governance

| Factor | Mechanism | Current Status |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Safety incidents** | Visible harm creates political will | Not yet significant |
| **Technical standards** | Provide basis for regulation | Developing (NIST, ISO) |
| **Institutional capacity** | Dedicated regulators | Emerging (AI Safety Institutes) |
| **International agreement** | Mutual standards | Early stage |
| **Industry support** | Self-interest in predictable rules | Mixed |

## Governance Gaps

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Description | Risk |
|-----|-------------|------|
| **Frontier models** | Limited oversight of most capable systems | High |
| **Open weights** | No governance framework | Medium-High |
| **International** | No binding global rules | High |
| **Enforcement** | Limited capacity to monitor compliance | High |
| **Speed** | Governance lags capability | High |

### Emerging Challenges

| Challenge | Status | Urgency |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **AGI governance** | No framework exists | High |
| **Autonomous weapons** | Incomplete treaties | High |
| **AI agents** | Undefined liability | Growing |
| **Compute governance** | Early proposals | Medium |

<Aside type="note" title="The Pacing Problem">
Traditional regulation develops over years; AI capabilities advance over months. This mismatch may require new governance approaches—adaptive regulation, sunset clauses, or technical standards that evolve with capabilities.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Extreme concentration** | 4-5 labs: 95%+ frontier | Few companies decide AI future |
| **Corporate structure varies** | Nonprofit, PBC, public division | Different incentives |
| **Talent concentration** | Top labs employ most key researchers | Knowledge concentrated |
| **Strategic divergence** | Different approaches to safety/openness | Varied risk profiles |
| **Governance gaps** | Limited oversight of corporate AI decisions | Accountability weak |

## Research Summary

The development of frontier AI is concentrated among a remarkably small number of companies. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta account for virtually all frontier model development in the West, with a handful of Chinese companies (Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance) filling a similar role in China. These companies' decisions about what to build, how to build it, and when to deploy it shape the trajectory of AI more than any government policy or international agreement.

The companies differ significantly in structure and approach. OpenAI began as a nonprofit but transitioned to a "capped-profit" structure with Microsoft as a major partner. Anthropic is a public benefit corporation explicitly focused on AI safety. Google DeepMind is a division of Alphabet, subject to public company pressures. Meta AI operates within Meta's social media business context. These different structures create different incentive patterns and strategic approaches.

Corporate governance of AI is a critical but underexplored issue. The executives and boards of these companies make decisions with global implications, but with limited accountability to affected populations. Traditional corporate governance mechanisms—shareholder voting, board oversight, market competition—may be poorly suited to governing technology with existential implications.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Corporate Power Over AI">
In most domains, we expect markets, governments, and civil society to balance corporate power. In frontier AI, the technology is so concentrated and fast-moving that a handful of corporate leaders have unprecedented influence over humanity's future.

## Key Findings

### Market Position

| Company | Estimated Market Share (Frontier) | Key Products |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **OpenAI** | 35-40% | GPT-4, GPT-4o, o1 |
| **Google DeepMind** | 25-30% | Gemini family |
| **Anthropic** | 15-20% | Claude 3, Claude 3.5 |
| **Meta** | 10-15% | Llama 3 (open weights) |
| **Others** | <10% | Various |

<Aside type="caution" title="Market Share vs Capability">
Market share by revenue differs from capability leadership. A company with smaller revenue might have more capable models. Measurement is further complicated by different evaluation methods.
</Aside>

### Safety Approaches by Company

|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **OpenAI** | 50+ (reduced) | Preparedness Framework | Closed, API |
| **Anthropic** | 100+ | Responsible Scaling Policy | Closed, API |
| **Google DeepMind** | 100+ | Frontier Safety Framework | Mostly closed |
| **Meta** | 30+ | Responsible AI | Open weights |
| **xAI** | Unknown | Limited public info | Open weights |

### Corporate Structure Comparison

| Company | Ownership | Profit Motive | Accountability |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **OpenAI** | Microsoft 49%, nonprofit rest | Capped, complex | Board, Microsoft |
| **Anthropic** | Investors | PBC mission constraint | Board, mission |
| **Google DeepMind** | Alphabet (public) | Strong | Public markets |
| **Meta** | Public (Zuckerberg control) | Strong | Zuckerberg |
| **xAI** | Private (Musk) | Unknown | Musk |

### Talent Concentration

| Company | Estimated Top Researchers | % of Global Top Talent |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|

## Causal Factors

### Factors Driving Corporate Concentration

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Capital requirements** | $1B+ per frontier run | Increasing |
| **Talent scarcity** | Few top researchers | Slowly improving |
| **Data advantages** | Proprietary data matters | Moderate |
| **Compute access** | Partnership with cloud providers | Concentrated |
| **First-mover advantage** | Early leads compound | Strong |

### Factors That Could Reduce Concentration

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Open weights** | Meta/others release models | Active but contested |
| **Algorithmic efficiency** | Reduce compute needs | Progressing |
| **New entrants** | Startups, national labs | Some emergence |
| **Antitrust action** | Break up concentrations | Limited |

## Governance Issues

### Internal Governance Challenges

| Issue | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Board-management tension** | Boards struggle to oversee technical decisions | OpenAI 2023 crisis |
| **Safety-product tension** | Safety teams vs. deployment pressure | Reported at multiple labs |
| **Founder power** | Individual founders have outsized influence | Multiple companies |
| **Transparency** | Limited visibility into decisions | Universal |

### External Governance Gaps

| Gap | Description | Risk |
|-----|-------------|------|
| **Regulatory lag** | No comprehensive AI company regulation | High |
| **Accountability vacuum** | Unclear responsibility for AI harm | High |
| **Democratic input** | No public say in AI strategy | High |
| **International coordination** | No global corporate AI governance | High |

<Aside type="note" title="Corporate Decisions, Global Consequences">
A handful of corporate executives make decisions about what AI capabilities to develop, what safeguards to implement, and when to deploy. These decisions affect all of humanity but are made with minimal public input.

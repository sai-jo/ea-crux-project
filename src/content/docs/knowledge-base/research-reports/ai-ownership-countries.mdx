## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **US dominance** | 60%+ of frontier models | Sets global standards |
| **China second** | 15-25% of frontier capability | Strategic competition |
| **EU lag** | No frontier labs | Regulatory but not capability power |
| **Talent concentration** | US attracts global AI talent | Reinforcing dynamics |
| **Geopolitical tension** | US-China competition | Coordination difficult |

## Research Summary

The development of advanced AI is heavily concentrated in a small number of countries, with the United States dominant and China as the primary competitor. The US hosts all major Western frontier AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI) and attracts the majority of global AI talent. China, while behind on some measures, is investing heavily and has made significant progress, particularly in applications and increasingly in frontier research.

This geographic concentration has profound implications. The values and priorities of US and Chinese societies—and their governments—will be disproportionately embedded in AI systems that affect the entire world. Countries without frontier AI capability will be dependent on others for transformative technology. The US-China rivalry creates racing dynamics that may undermine safety, while making international coordination on AI governance extremely difficult.

Other regions—the EU, UK, Japan, and emerging powers—face strategic questions about AI development. The EU has chosen regulatory leadership over capability development. The UK aims to balance safety research with competitiveness. Smaller countries must navigate a world where AI power is concentrated elsewhere.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Geographic Distribution Matters">
Where AI is developed determines whose interests it serves, whose values it embeds, and who has power over its deployment. Geographic concentration means most of humanity has limited say in AI development that will affect everyone.
</Aside>

### Current AI Geography

| Region | Role | AI Strategy |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **United States** | Frontier leader | Private sector-led, light regulation |
| **China** | Strategic competitor | State-directed, national priority |
| **EU** | Regulatory power | Ethics/safety focus, limited capability |
| **UK** | Safety focus | AI Safety Institute, research |
| **Others** | Varied | Application, not frontier |

### AI Power Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Geographic Distribution |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Frontier models** | Most capable systems | US (60%+), China (20%+), Others (<20%) |
| **Compute** | Training resources | US (50%+), China (30%+) |
| **Talent** | Top researchers | US (40%+), China (15%+), dispersed |
| **Investment** | R&D spending | US (50%+), China (30%+) |
| **Applications** | Deployment scale | US, China, then global |

## Key Findings

### Frontier Model Development

| Country/Region | Major Labs | Frontier Models |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **United States** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama |
| **China** | Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance | ERNIE, Qwen, others |
| **France** | Mistral | Mistral family |
| **UAE** | Technology Innovation Institute | Falcon |
| **Others** | Various | Below frontier |

<Aside type="caution" title="Measurement Challenges">
Comparing AI capabilities across countries is difficult. China may underreport military AI; private company capabilities are opaque; benchmarks may not capture relevant dimensions.
</Aside>

### AI Investment by Country

| Country | Annual AI R&D (est.) | % of Global |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **United States** | $50B+ | ~50% |
| **China** | $30B+ | ~30% |
| **EU (combined)** | $10B+ | ~10% |
| **UK** | $3B+ | ~3% |
| **Others** | $7B+ | ~7% |

### Talent Distribution

| Metric | US Share | China Share | Other |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Top AI researchers** | 40%+ | 15%+ | 45% dispersed |
| **PhDs produced** | 20%+ | 30%+ | 50%+ (many go to US) |
| **Researcher employment** | 50%+ | 20%+ | 30% |
| **Brain drain beneficiary** | Yes | Neutral | Net exporters |

### Compute Access

| Resource | US Control | China Control | Other |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Cloud AI compute** | 70%+ | 20%+ | <10% |
| **Advanced chips (production)** | 0% (but controls via allies) | 0% | Taiwan 90% |
| **Chip design** | 60%+ (NVIDIA, AMD) | Growing | 30%+ |
| **Training clusters** | 60%+ | 30%+ | <10% |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Maintaining US Dominance

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Talent attraction** | Immigration, salaries, ecosystem | Strong |
| **Venture capital** | Funding for startups | Strong |
| **Tech ecosystem** | Silicon Valley, universities | Entrenched |
| **Compute access** | Cloud providers, chip supply | Strong |
| **Export controls** | Limit competitor access | Active |

### Factors Enabling China's Progress

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **State investment** | Government prioritization | Strong |
| **Data access** | Large population, weak privacy | Strong |
| **Talent pool** | Growing STEM education | Strong |
| **Chip investment** | Domestic alternatives | Growing |
| **Application focus** | Deploy at scale | Strong |

### Factors Limiting Other Countries

| Factor | Affected Countries | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Talent drain** | EU, India, others | Best leave for US |
| **Scale disadvantage** | Smaller countries | Can't match investment |
| **Chip access** | Non-allies | Export controls |
| **Regulatory burden** | EU | AI Act compliance costs |

## Geopolitical Implications

### US-China Competition

| Dimension | US Position | China Position | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Capability race** | Leading | Catching up | Racing dynamics |
| **Export controls** | Imposing | Circumventing | Tech decoupling |
| **Standards setting** | Western-led | Alternative standards | Fragmented governance |
| **Military AI** | Advanced | Advancing rapidly | Arms race |
| **Safety cooperation** | Limited openness | Very limited | Hard to coordinate |

### Middle Powers' Choices

| Country/Region | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **EU** | Regulate, values-based | Leverage market access |
| **UK** | Safety research, bridge role | Influence without scale |
| **Japan** | Partnership with US | Security alliance |
| **India** | Application, talent | Scale advantages |
| **UAE/Saudi** | Investment, infrastructure | Sovereign capability |

<Aside type="note" title="The Governance Gap">
Countries that develop AI have limited incentive to constrain themselves; countries without AI capability have limited leverage. This creates a governance gap where global AI risks are managed by few actors.

## Background

AI talent concentration—where the world's top AI researchers choose to work and study—is a critical factor in the AI capabilities landscape. The geographic distribution of talent affects which entities lead AI development, the speed of capability advancement, and AI safety outcomes.

<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters for AI Safety">
If talent migrates to jurisdictions with weaker safety norms or less transparency, it could accelerate risky development outside the reach of current governance efforts. Understanding talent flows helps predict where frontier capabilities will emerge.

## Key Findings

### US Remains the Top Destination

According to the [MacroPolo Global AI Talent Tracker 2.0](https://archivemacropolo.org/interactive/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/), the United States remains far ahead as the destination for elite AI talent:

| Metric | US Share | Change from 2019 |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Top 2% of AI talent working | 57% | Slight decline |
| Top AI institutions hosted | 60% | Stable |
| Top-tier talent staying after US graduate school | 80% | Stable |

The [Stanford AI Index 2025](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) reinforces this: US institutions produced 40 notable AI models in 2024, compared to China's 15 and Europe's combined 3.

<Aside type="note" title="Data Source Limitation">
MacroPolo's tracker used NeurIPS 2022 conference acceptances as a proxy for top-tier talent. After eight years, MacroPolo ceased operations in 2024, so this dataset will not be updated. Future analysis will need alternative methodologies.
</Aside>

### China's Rising Talent Production

China has dramatically increased its share of top AI researcher production:

| Year | China's Share (by undergrad origin) | US Share | Gap |
|------|-------------------------------------|----------|-----|
| 2019 | 29% | 20% | China +9% |
| 2022 | 47% | ~20% | China +27% |

**Talent composition in the US** shows significant reliance on Chinese-born researchers:

| Origin | Share of Top-Tier AI Researchers in US |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| US-born | 37% |
| Chinese-born | 38% |
| Other countries | 25% |

This creates a complex dynamic: the US relies heavily on Chinese talent for its AI workforce, while China increasingly retains its own graduates domestically.

### Declining Global Mobility

| Year | Top-tier Researchers Working Abroad | Change |
|------|-------------------------------------|--------|
| 2019 | 55% | — |
| 2022 | 42% | -13 percentage points |

<Aside type="caution" title="Trend Implications">
This 13-point decline in mobility suggests a structural shift. Contributing factors include: expanded domestic opportunities in China, tighter immigration environments globally, and nationalist policies encouraging domestic retention. If this trend continues, talent distribution could fragment significantly.
</Aside>

### Immigration Policy Risks

Recent US immigration policy changes pose risks to talent attraction:

| Policy Change | Details | Impact |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **H-1B Fee Increase** | \$100,000 fee (Sep 2025), up from \$2,000-\$5,000 | "Essentially a startup tax"—disadvantages startups vs. Big Tech |
| **Visa Uncertainty** | Duration of status changes proposed | Creates planning uncertainty for researchers |
| **Competing Programs** | China K visa, South Korea K-Tech Pass | Other nations actively recruiting |

**Key statistic**: [60% of top AI startups have immigrant founders](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-immigration-policies-may-threaten-american-ai-leadership/), and 70% of those first came to the US on student visas.

<Aside type="tip" title="Competing National Programs">
**China**: Launched K visa (October 2025) for research stays without employer sponsorship.
**South Korea**: K-Tech Pass (September 2024) for graduates of top 100 universities.
**UK/Australia/Canada**: Straightforward post-graduate work permits allowing immediate employment after graduation.
</Aside>

### Global Investment Gap

| Country | 2024 Private AI Investment | Relative to US |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------|
| United States | \$109.1 billion | 1x |
| China | \$9.3 billion | 0.09x (12x less) |
| United Kingdom | \$4.5 billion | 0.04x (24x less) |

## Causal Factors

The following factors influence AI talent concentration. This table is designed to inform future cause-effect diagram creation.

### Primary Factors (Strong Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Immigration Policy** | ↑↓ US Concentration | leaf | 80% retention depends on visa pathways; \$100K fee threatens startups | High |
| **Research Ecosystem Quality** | ↑ Concentration | cause | US hosts 60% of top institutions; talent follows opportunities | High |
| **Private Investment** | ↑ Concentration | leaf | \$109B US investment creates positions unavailable elsewhere | High |

### Secondary Factors (Medium Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Graduate Program Quality** | ↑ Concentration | cause | 80% of US graduate students stay; key pipeline | Medium |
| **Competing National Programs** | ↓ US Concentration | leaf | China K visa, South Korea K-Tech Pass compete actively | Medium |
| **Cost of Living** | Mixed | intermediate | SF Bay Area costs may deter some; not quantified | Low |

### Minor Factors (Weak Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Nationalist Sentiment** | ↓ Mobility | leaf | 55% → 42% abroad suggests "stay home" effect | Low |
| **Language/Cultural Barriers** | ↓ Cross-border flow | intermediate | Limited; AI research primarily in English | Low |

## Open Questions

<Aside type="note" title="Key Uncertainties">
These questions represent the highest-value areas for follow-up research:
</Aside>

| Question | Why It Matters | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Will H-1B fees persist?** | \$100K fee dramatically changes startup economics | May face legal challenge or policy reversal |
| **Is China's talent surge sustainable?** | 47% share may reflect training expansion vs. durable advantage | Unclear; depends on retention rates |
| **How does concentration affect safety?** | Talent in weak-safety jurisdictions could accelerate risks | Under-researched |
| **What are the lag effects?** | 2022 data won't show 2024-2025 policy impacts for years | Need better real-time indicators |
| **Industry vs. academic split?** | 90% of notable models from industry—academic talent may matter less | Frontier work concentrated in labs |

## AI Transition Model Context

<Aside type="tip" title="Model Integration">
This research relates to the **AI Capabilities** factor in the AI Transition Model. Talent concentration affects algorithmic progress, geographic distribution of development, and which entities have capabilities relevant to AI takeover or misuse scenarios.
</Aside>

The concentration of talent in the US (and dependence on Chinese-born researchers) creates both:
- **Opportunities**: Potential for safety coordination among concentrated talent
- **Vulnerabilities**: Policy disruptions could fragment safety-conscious community

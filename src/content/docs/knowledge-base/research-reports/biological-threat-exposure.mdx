| **Knowledge access** | Synthesis routes retrievable | Information barriers reduced |
| **Expert gap narrowing** | PhD-level guidance accessible | Democratization of capability |
| **Model safeguards** | Inconsistent across providers | Protection gaps exist |
| **Timeline** | Near-term risk increase | Current models pose concerns |

## Research Summary

AI's impact on biological threat exposure represents one of the most concrete and near-term AI safety concerns. Multiple evaluations have demonstrated that current large language models can provide meaningful assistance to individuals seeking to develop biological weapons. OpenAI's evaluation of GPT-4 found it provided "at most a mild uplift" to experts but more significant assistance to non-experts. Anthropic's studies suggest uplift factors of 1.3-2.5x for certain tasks.

The concern is not that AI enables biological attacks that were previously impossible—determined state actors have long possessed these capabilities. Rather, AI lowers the knowledge barriers that previously limited the pool of potential actors. Tasks that once required years of specialized training or access to classified information can now be partially assisted by widely available AI systems. This includes guidance on pathogen selection, synthesis routes, genetic modification strategies, and evasion of detection.

Current safeguards are inconsistent. While frontier labs implement filters on bioweapon-related queries, these protections vary in effectiveness, can sometimes be circumvented through prompt engineering, and may not exist in open-weight models. The dual-use nature of biology knowledge makes it difficult to restrict harmful applications without also limiting beneficial research.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters Now">
Unlike many AI risks that depend on future capability advances, biological threat uplift is demonstrable with current models. This makes it both more tractable to assess and more urgent to address.

## Key Findings

### Evaluated Uplift by Task

| Task | Expert Uplift | Non-Expert Uplift | Source |
|------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Pathogen selection** | Minimal | Moderate-High | OpenAI (2024) |
| **Synthesis planning** | Low | Moderate | Anthropic (2024) |
| **Modification strategies** | Low-Moderate | Moderate-High | RAND (2024) |
| **Acquisition planning** | Minimal | Low-Moderate | Various |
| **Overall bioweapon development** | ~1.0-1.3x | ~1.3-2.5x | Aggregated |

<Aside type="caution" title="Evaluation Limitations">
Uplift studies face methodological challenges: participants may not represent actual threat actors, ethical constraints limit realism, and studies can't capture all relevant pathways. True uplift may be higher or lower than measured.
</Aside>

### Pathogen Categories of Concern

| Category | AI Assistance Level | Physical Barriers |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Bacterial agents** | High | Moderate (some culturable) |
| **Viral agents** | High | High (synthesis difficult) |
| **Toxins** | Moderate | Low-Moderate |
| **Novel pathogens** | Moderate | Very High |
| **Enhanced pathogens** | High | High |

### Current Safeguards Assessment

| Provider | Safeguard Type | Effectiveness | Circumvention Risk |

| **Open-weight models** | Community-imposed | Low | High |

### Studies and Evaluations

| Study | Year | Key Finding |
|-------|------|-------------|

## Risk Assessment

### Threat Actor Analysis

| Actor Type | Current Capability | AI Uplift | Overall Risk Increase |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **State actors** | High | Low | Marginal |
| **Sophisticated groups** | Moderate | Moderate | Significant |
| **Motivated individuals** | Low | High | Substantial |
| **Opportunistic actors** | Very Low | Moderate | Notable |

### Scenario Probabilities

| Scenario | Pre-AI Probability | Post-AI Change | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| **State bioweapon use** | Low | Minimal change | Already capable |
| **Terrorist attack** | Very Low | Moderate increase | Barriers lowering |
| **Lone actor attack** | Extremely Low | Notable increase | Biggest relative change |
| **Laboratory accident** | Low | Possible increase | More amateur labs |

<Aside type="note" title="Probability vs Impact">
Even small probability increases for biological attacks are concerning given potential impacts. A 0.1% to 1% increase in annual attack probability represents a significant risk shift over time.

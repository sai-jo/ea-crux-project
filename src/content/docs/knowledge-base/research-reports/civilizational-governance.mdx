## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Governance innovation** | Historically takes decades-centuries | Mismatch with AI pace |
| **International coordination** | Weak for AI | Global challenges underaddressed |
| **Democratic strain** | Trust declining, polarization rising | Legitimacy challenges |
| **Technical expertise gap** | Regulators lag industry | Effective oversight difficult |
| **Governance experiments** | Many underway | Some grounds for optimism |

## Research Summary

Civilizational governance refers to humanity's collective capacity to make decisions, coordinate action, and establish rules across societies. This includes democratic processes, international institutions, regulatory bodies, and informal coordination mechanisms. Strong governance capacity is essential for navigating the AI transition—ensuring AI benefits are broadly shared, risks are managed, and catastrophic outcomes are prevented.

Current governance systems face significant challenges in addressing AI. Democratic processes evolved for slower-changing contexts and struggle with technical complexity. International institutions are weak and fragmented on AI issues. Regulatory bodies often lack the technical expertise to understand what they're regulating. The gap between AI capability development and governance capacity is widening.

However, governance is also adapting. The EU AI Act represents the first comprehensive AI regulation. AI safety institutes are being established in multiple countries. International coordination efforts like the Bletchley process are emerging. The question is whether these adaptations can accelerate fast enough to address AI challenges before they become unmanageable.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Governance and AI Risk">
Many AI risks are governance failures: racing dynamics, inadequate safety investment, and coordination problems could be addressed with better institutions. Governance capacity is a meta-capability that affects all other factors.

### Governance Layers

| Layer | Scope | Examples | AI Relevance |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Global** | Humanity | UN, treaties | Coordination on AGI |
| **International** | Multi-country | EU, G20 | Regional standards |
| **National** | Single country | Laws, agencies | Domestic regulation |
| **Corporate** | Companies | Governance, boards | Lab decisions |
| **Community** | Groups | Norms, standards | Professional standards |

### Historical Governance Innovations

| Innovation | Development Time | Challenge Addressed |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Democratic institutions** | Centuries | Legitimate authority |
| **International law** | 200+ years | Cross-border disputes |
| **Financial regulation** | 100+ years | Market stability |
| **Nuclear governance** | 50+ years | Weapons control |
| **Internet governance** | 30+ years | Digital coordination |
| **AI governance** | <10 years | In development |

## Key Findings

### Current Governance Capacity

| Domain | Capacity Level | Key Gaps |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Domestic AI regulation** | Emerging | Technical expertise, speed |
| **International coordination** | Weak | No binding agreements |
| **Industry self-governance** | Variable | Enforcement, coverage |
| **Technical standards** | Developing | Slow, voluntary |
| **Emergency response** | Limited | No AI crisis mechanisms |

<Aside type="caution" title="The Governance Deficit">
AI governance is developing but the gap between what exists and what's needed is large and potentially growing—capabilities advance faster than governance adapts.
</Aside>

### Democratic Governance and AI

| Indicator | Trend | Implication |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Trust in democracy** | Declining | Legitimacy for AI policy weakened |
| **Technical literacy** | Low among voters/legislators | Informed oversight difficult |
| **Attention span** | Fragmented | Long-term AI issues neglected |
| **Polarization** | Increasing | Consensus on AI policy harder |
| **Capture risk** | High | Industry influences regulation |

### International Coordination Assessment

| Mechanism | Status | Effectiveness |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **UN processes** | Active but slow | Low |
| **G7/G20** | Some attention | Moderate |
| **Bletchley/Seoul** | New, promising | Too early |
| **Bilateral US-China** | Very limited | Low |
| **Technical bodies** | Developing | Moderate |

### Regulatory Capacity

| Jurisdiction | Dedicated AI Regulator | Technical Expertise | Industry Gap |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **EU** | AI Office (new) | Building | Large |
| **US** | None (fragmented) | Limited | Very large |
| **UK** | AI Safety Institute | Growing | Moderate |
| **China** | CAC (partial) | Moderate | Moderate |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Governance Capacity

| Factor | Mechanism | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Speed mismatch** | AI faster than governance | High |
| **Technical complexity** | Hard to understand what to regulate | High |
| **Global nature** | Requires international coordination | High |
| **Uncertainty** | Hard to regulate unknown futures | High |
| **Industry lobbying** | Weakens proposed regulations | Medium-High |

### Factors That Could Strengthen Governance

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **AI crisis/incident** | Creates political will | Not yet occurred |
| **Technical standards** | Provide basis for regulation | Developing |
| **Expert networks** | Share knowledge across governments | Growing |
| **Demonstration effects** | Successful governance copied | EU AI Act as model |
| **AI-assisted governance** | AI helps govern AI | Experimental |

## Governance Approaches

### Regulatory Approaches

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Risk-based** | Requirements based on risk level | EU AI Act |
| **Use-based** | Regulate specific applications | China regulations |
| **Capability-based** | Requirements above capability thresholds | US EO compute thresholds |
| **Outcome-based** | Focus on harms, not methods | Product liability |

### Non-Regulatory Approaches

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Voluntary commitments** | Industry self-regulation | Frontier Model Forum |
| **Technical standards** | Shared specifications | NIST AI RMF |
| **Procurement** | Government buying requirements | US AI procurement |
| **Insurance** | Risk transfer mechanisms | Emerging AI insurance |
| **Liability** | Legal responsibility for harms | Proposed reforms |

### International Approaches

| Approach | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Treaties** | Binding international law | None on AI |
| **Soft law** | Non-binding declarations | Bletchley, Seoul |
| **Mutual recognition** | Accept each other's standards | Proposed |
| **Technical cooperation** | Shared research | AI Safety Institutes |

<Aside type="note" title="Governance Innovation Needed">
Traditional governance approaches may be insufficient for AI. New mechanisms—adaptive regulation, anticipatory governance, AI-assisted oversight—may be required.
</Aside>

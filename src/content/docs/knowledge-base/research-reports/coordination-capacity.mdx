## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **International weak** | No binding AI treaties | Global risks unaddressed |
| **National polarized** | Limited domestic consensus | Inconsistent policy |
| **Industry limited** | Some lab coordination | Self-interested |
| **Collective action problems** | Racing, free-riding | Structural barriers |
| **Need unprecedented** | AI requires more coordination than achieved | Major gap |

## Research Summary

Coordination capacity—the ability of multiple actors to align behavior toward common goals—is essential for addressing AI risks that cross organizational, national, and sectoral boundaries. AI's global development means that purely local governance leaves gaps. AI's racing dynamics create collective action problems where individually rational behavior produces collectively harmful outcomes. And AI's complexity requires coordination across technical, policy, and business domains.

Current coordination capacity is weak relative to what AI governance requires. Internationally, there are no binding treaties and US-China cooperation is minimal. Domestically, political polarization limits consensus on AI policy. Industry coordination exists but is constrained by competitive pressures. And coordination across government, industry, civil society, and technical communities is ad hoc.

Building coordination capacity requires investment in institutions, trust, and mechanisms for collective decision-making. Historical examples—from arms control to environmental agreements—show that coordination is possible but typically requires decades and often crises to achieve. The question is whether AI timelines allow for traditional coordination processes or whether new, faster approaches are needed.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Coordination Matters">
Many AI risks are collective action problems: racing, safety investment, information sharing. Without coordination, individually rational choices produce collectively harmful outcomes.
</Aside>

### Coordination Levels

| Level | Description | Current Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **International** | Between nations | Very weak |
| **National** | Within governments | Moderate, fragmented |
| **Industry** | Between companies | Limited |
| **Cross-sector** | Government-industry-civil society | Ad hoc |
| **Technical** | Among researchers | Moderate |

### Coordination Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Racing** | Each actor benefits from moving fast | Prisoner's dilemma |
| **Free-riding** | Benefit from others' safety investment | Collective action |
| **Information asymmetry** | Don't know what others are doing | Trust problems |
| **Value differences** | Disagree on goals | Negotiation difficulty |
| **Complexity** | Too many dimensions to coordinate | Cognitive limits |

## Key Findings

### International Coordination Status

| Mechanism | Status | Effectiveness |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Binding treaties** | None | N/A |
| **Soft commitments** | Bletchley, Seoul | Normative |
| **Technical cooperation** | AI Safety Institutes | Building |
| **US-China dialogue** | Very limited | Minimal |
| **Multilateral forums** | Active | Slow |

<Aside type="caution" title="Unprecedented Need">
AI may require coordination faster and deeper than historical precedents. Nuclear arms control took decades and near-misses. AI may not allow that timeline.
</Aside>

### Domestic Coordination Status

| Country | Political Consensus | Agency Coordination | Status |
|---------|--------------------| --------------------|--------|
| **US** | Low (polarized) | Low (fragmented) | Weak |
| **EU** | Moderate | Building | Moderate |
| **UK** | Moderate | Improving | Moderate |
| **China** | High (state-directed) | High | Strong internally |

### Industry Coordination Status

| Mechanism | Participants | Scope | Enforcement |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **Frontier Model Forum** | Major labs | Safety practices | Voluntary |
| **Partnership on AI** | Broader industry | Principles | None |
| **Standards bodies** | Various | Technical | Market |
| **Bilateral agreements** | Lab pairs | Specific issues | Contractual |

### Cross-Sector Coordination

| Type | Examples | Effectiveness |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Government-industry** | White House commitments | Ad hoc |
| **Industry-academia** | Research partnerships | Variable |
| **Civil society-government** | Advocacy influence | Limited |
| **Multi-stakeholder** | AI governance forums | Early |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Coordination

| Factor | Mechanism | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Competition** | Zero-sum framing | High |
| **Trust deficit** | Don't believe others will comply | High |
| **Verification difficulty** | Can't check compliance | High |
| **Speed** | Can't coordinate fast enough | High |
| **Complexity** | Too many dimensions | Moderate |

### Factors That Could Enable Coordination

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Shared risk perception** | Common threat motivates | Growing |
| **Technical community** | Researchers collaborate | Active |
| **Crisis** | Creates urgency | Not yet |
| **Leadership** | Champions push coordination | Some |
| **Institutions** | Bodies facilitate | Building |

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Hard Coordination

| Mechanism | Description | AI Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Treaties** | Binding international law | None |
| **Regulations** | Binding national law | Emerging |
| **Contracts** | Binding agreements | Some |
| **Standards** | Required specifications | Developing |

### Soft Coordination

| Mechanism | Description | AI Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Norms** | Shared expectations | Building |
| **Declarations** | Non-binding commitments | Active |
| **Best practices** | Shared methods | Developing |
| **Information sharing** | Mutual awareness | Limited |

### Emergent Coordination

| Mechanism | Description | AI Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Focal points** | Natural coordination points | Some |
| **Imitation** | Follow leaders | Active |
| **Reputation** | Maintain good standing | Some |
| **Networks** | Relationship-based | Building |

<Aside type="note" title="Building Coordination">
Coordination capacity is built, not found. It requires investment in relationships, institutions, and trust. Current capacity reflects past investment; future capacity depends on present choices.

## Building Coordination Capacity

### Institutional Investment

| Institution | Function | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **AI Safety Institutes** | Technical coordination | Growing |
| **International bodies** | Diplomatic coordination | Weak |
| **Industry associations** | Sector coordination | Existing |
| **Research networks** | Technical coordination | Active |

### Trust Building

| Approach | Mechanism | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Information sharing** | Demonstrate good faith | Limited |
| **Verification** | Reduce need for trust | Difficult |
| **Small wins** | Build track record | Some |
| **Relationships** | Personal connections | Variable |

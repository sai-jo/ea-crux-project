## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Vulnerability discovery** | 10-100x speedup | Faster exploit development |
| **Phishing effectiveness** | 3-5x improvement | Social engineering scales |
| **Attack automation** | Fully autonomous possible | Lower skill barriers |
| **Defense AI** | Also advancing | Arms race dynamics |
| **Critical infrastructure** | High exposure | Catastrophic potential |

## Research Summary

AI is transforming the cyber threat landscape by dramatically lowering the cost and skill requirements for conducting sophisticated attacks while enabling new attack categories. Large language models can generate convincing phishing emails, malware code, and social engineering scripts with minimal attacker expertise. AI-powered tools can discover vulnerabilities 10-100x faster than manual methods, and autonomous attack systems that can adapt in real-time are beginning to emerge.

The democratization of cyber attack capabilities represents a fundamental shift. Previously, sophisticated cyber operations required nation-state resources or highly skilled criminal organizations. AI tools now enable moderately skilled actors to conduct attacks that would have been beyond their capabilities just a few years ago. This expands the threat actor pool significantly and increases the volume and sophistication of attacks organizations must defend against.

Defensive AI is also advancing, creating an arms race dynamic. AI-powered threat detection, anomaly identification, and automated response systems are improving. However, the offense-defense balance appears to favor attackers: it's easier to find one vulnerability than to defend all of them, and AI amplifies this asymmetry. Critical infrastructure—power grids, water systems, financial networks—faces particular risk from AI-enhanced attacks that could cause cascading physical-world effects.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="The Offense-Defense Balance">
In cybersecurity, attackers typically have structural advantages: they only need to find one weakness, while defenders must protect everything. AI amplifies this asymmetry by automating vulnerability discovery and attack execution.

|-----|----------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Pre-2010** | Script kiddie to nation-state | High for advanced | Low |
| **2010-2020** | Automated scanning, ransomware | Medium | Increasing |
| **2020-2023** | AI-assisted attacks emerge | Medium-Low | High |
| **2023-present** | AI-native attack tools | Low | Very High |

### AI-Enhanced Attack Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Social engineering** | AI-generated phishing, voice cloning |

## Key Findings

### AI Attack Capability Improvements

| Capability | Pre-AI Baseline | AI Enhancement | Source |
|------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Phishing success rate** | 3-5% | 15-25% (3-5x) | Various studies |
| **Vulnerability discovery** | Days-weeks | Hours (10-100x) | Academic research |

| **Voice cloning attacks** | Not practical | Commercially viable | Deepfake studies |

<Aside type="caution" title="Measurement Challenges">
Quantifying AI's impact on cyber threats is difficult. Attack statistics often lag, adversaries don't publish methods, and controlled studies may not capture real-world conditions.

| **Web application attacks** | High | High |
| **Supply chain attacks** | Moderate | High |
| **Infrastructure attacks** | Moderate-High | Critical if targeted |

### Threat Actor Enhancement

| Actor Type | Pre-AI Capability | Post-AI Capability | Risk Change |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Nation-states** | Very High | Higher | Moderate increase |
| **Cybercrime groups** | High | Very High | Significant |
| **Hacktivists** | Moderate | High | Significant |

## Offense-Defense Dynamics

### Current Balance Assessment

| Factor | Favors Offense | Favors Defense |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Vulnerability discovery** | ✓ (faster) | |
| **Attack automation** | ✓ (lower barrier) | |
| **Detection** | | ✓ (AI anomaly detection) |
| **Attribution** | ✓ (easier to hide) | |
| **Patch deployment** | | ✓ (AI-assisted) |
| **Social engineering** | ✓ (scales better) | |
| **Response** | | ✓ (faster containment) |

<Aside type="note" title="Net Assessment">
The overall balance likely favors offense, particularly for sophisticated attacks. Defense can improve but faces fundamental asymmetries: one vulnerability is enough for attackers, while defenders must protect everything.
</Aside>

### Future Trajectory

| Capability | 2025 | 2027 | 2030 |
|------------|------|------|------|
| **Autonomous penetration testing** | Limited | Moderate | Advanced |
| **AI-to-AI attack/defense** | Emerging | Growing | Dominant |

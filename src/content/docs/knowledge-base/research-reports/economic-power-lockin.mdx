## Research Summary

Economic power lock-in occurs when AI-driven productivity becomes so concentrated that redistribution becomes structurally impossible—not merely politically difficult. Current market data reveals this pattern is already emerging: four "mega unicorns" (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Databricks) control 66.7% of the \$1.1 trillion AI market value. Only approximately 20 organizations globally can afford frontier model training costs of \$100M-\$1B+, creating natural monopoly characteristics in AI development.

Three interlocking mechanisms drive concentration. First, massive capital requirements create barriers to entry—frontier AI training costs grew at 2.4× per year, with projections reaching \$10 billion by decade's end. Second, data feedback loops advantage incumbents: more users generate more data, improving models, attracting more users. Third, infrastructure dependencies lock in customers, with 66-70% of cloud computing controlled by three providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), all owned by companies with competing AI products.

The IMF explicitly warns that "in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality," with 40% of global jobs exposed to automation. Labor market disruption is accelerating: 76,440 positions were eliminated in early 2025, with projections of 92 million displaced by 2030. Critically, current antitrust frameworks focus on consumer prices (the "rule of reason" from Standard Oil) rather than structural power concentration—an approach designed for industrial monopolies that fails to address platform economics and data-driven competitive advantages. The window for structural intervention narrows as each year of concentration builds self-reinforcing advantages.

---

## Background

Economic power lock-in represents a failure mode where AI-enabled productivity becomes permanently concentrated in hands so few that redistribution becomes structurally impossible—not merely politically difficult. This scenario differs from historical inequality in that it embeds economic hierarchy into technological and institutional infrastructure in ways that foreclose alternative arrangements.

<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters for AI Safety">
Economic lock-in is distinctive because each step appears beneficial: AI systems increase productivity, create economic value, and deliver consumer benefits. The catastrophic outcome emerges from the accumulation of individually rational decisions that concentrate power in ways that become irreversible. This makes it harder to generate political will for intervention before the lock-in threshold is crossed.
</Aside>

The mechanisms enabling economic lock-in are already visible. Frontier AI development requires massive capital investments, with training costs projected to reach \$1-10 billion by 2030. The AI startup ecosystem shows extreme concentration, with the [top 25 companies representing over \$1 trillion in combined valuation](https://writerbuddy.ai/blog/top-50-ai). Market dynamics favor incumbents through data feedback loops, returns to scale, and infrastructure dependencies.

The IMF explicitly warns that ["in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality"](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729), with 40% of global jobs exposed to AI automation. The critical question is whether this represents transitional disruption (like previous technological revolutions) or permanent restructuring of economic power.

## Key Findings

### The Market Concentration Crisis

The AI industry exhibits concentration levels unprecedented in recent technological history:

| Concentration Metric | Current State | Trend | Source |
|---------------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Top 4 market share** | 66.7% of total AI startup value | Increasing | [Eqvista (2025)](https://eqvista.com/top-ai-startups-by-valuation/) |
| **Frontier model developers** | ~20 organizations globally | Decreasing | Existing page |
| **Cloud infrastructure (top 3)** | 66-70% market share | Stable/increasing | Existing page |
| **VC funding concentration** | 33% of global VC to AI (2024) | Historically rare | [Carta (2024)](https://carta.com/data/ai-fundraising-trends-2024/) |
| **Geographic concentration** | 94% of AI funding in US (\$49.4B) | Increasing | [WriterBuddy (2024)](https://writerbuddy.ai/blog/top-50-ai) |
| **Sector concentration** | 67% to AI Infrastructure & Models | Increasing | WriterBuddy |

<Aside type="caution" title="Natural Monopoly Dynamics">
[RAND analysis](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3415-1.html) finds that foundation models exhibit natural monopoly characteristics: the total cost of serving full market demand is lower for a single firm than for multiple firms. Unlike conventional monopolies, traditional antitrust policy cannot be assumed to alleviate problems associated with this concentrated market power. This makes the concentration structurally inevitable absent regulatory intervention.
</Aside>

The concentration is driven by several mutually reinforcing factors:

**1. Massive Fixed Costs**

Training frontier models now costs \$100M-\$1B, with projections suggesting costs will continue escalating. [Research from the Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/neural-network-effects-scaling-and-market-structure-in-artificial-intelligence) notes that "one important driver is growing fixed costs for pre-training frontier AI models, which now costs hundreds of millions of dollars, with projections suggesting billion-dollar price tags within the next few years."

**2. Data Feedback Loops**

Better models attract more users, generating more data, which improves the models—a virtuous cycle for incumbents. As INET researchers observe: "Data feedback loops are one key force, whereby better models attract more users, generating more data, which improves the models – a virtuous cycle for incumbents."

**3. User Lock-in**

Once users become accustomed to a particular AI system, switching costs create lock-in effects. Combined with infrastructure dependencies (most AI services run on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud), this creates multiple layers of lock-in.

### Winner-Take-All Dynamics: Theory and Evidence

Academic research provides a mixed picture of winner-take-all dynamics in AI markets:

<Aside type="note" title="Contested Territory">
[Herbert Hovenkamp's Yale Law Journal analysis](https://yalelawjournal.org/article/antitrust-and-platform-monopoly) argues that "large digital platforms that deal directly with consumers, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, are not 'winner-take-all' firms. They must compete on the merits or otherwise rely on exclusionary practices to attain or maintain dominance." However, this analysis predates the current AI concentration and focuses on consumer platforms rather than infrastructure/foundation models.
</Aside>

More recent research specific to AI foundation models reaches different conclusions. [ArXiv paper on market concentration (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01550) observes that "the most capable models will have a tendency towards natural monopoly and may have potentially vast markets."

The tension between these perspectives reflects genuine uncertainty about whether AI follows traditional platform economics or represents a new category. Key differences:

| Platform Type | Network Effects | Market Structure | Historical Example |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Consumer social** | Strong direct effects | Winner-take-all | Facebook, early Twitter |
| **Enterprise software** | Weak/fragmented | Multi-vendor | CRM, ERP systems |
| **AI foundation models** | Data feedback loops | Natural monopoly tendency | TBD |
| **AI infrastructure** | Lock-in via switching costs | Oligopoly (3-4 players) | Cloud computing |

### Labor Displacement and Economic Restructuring

The labor market impacts of AI are accelerating faster than most projections anticipated:

**Current Displacement (2025)**

[Academic research documenting 2025 impacts](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5316265) finds that "AI job displacement is not a future threat but a current reality, with 76,440 positions already eliminated in 2025." The effects are not evenly distributed:

| Worker Category | Unemployment Impact | Timeframe | Source |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Tech workers (20-30 years old)** | +3 percentage points | Since Jan 2025 | [Stanford Digital Economy](https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf) |
| **Computer/mathematical occupations** | Steepest unemployment rises | 2025 | Stanford |
| **Professional services openings** | -20% year-over-year | Jan 2025 | [SalesforceDevops](https://salesforcedevops.net/index.php/2025/02/28/the-white-collar-recession-of-2025/) |
| **White-collar job seekers** | 40% failed to secure interview | 2024 | SalesforceDevops |
| **High-paying positions (\$96K+)** | Decade-low hiring | 2024-2025 | SalesforceDevops |

**Projected Displacement (2030)**

[Goldman Sachs Research estimates](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce) project 92 million jobs displaced by 2030, with 170 million new ones emerging. However, as the research notes: "These aren't direct exchanges happening in the same locations with the same individuals."

<Aside type="caution" title="The Geographic and Skills Mismatch">
The displacement-to-new-jobs ratio obscures critical mismatches: 77% of new AI jobs require master's degrees, creating substantial skills gaps. Meanwhile, displaced workers are concentrated in specific sectors and geographies, while new opportunities cluster in AI hubs. This creates localized economic collapse even if aggregate employment remains stable.
</Aside>

**The White-Collar Focus**

Unlike previous automation waves that primarily affected blue-collar manufacturing, AI disproportionately impacts white-collar cognitive work—traditionally the pathway to economic mobility:

> "In January 2025, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the lowest rate of job openings in professional services since 2013—a 20% year-over-year drop." — [SalesforceDevops analysis](https://salesforcedevops.net/index.php/2025/02/28/the-white-collar-recession-of-2025/)

This matters for lock-in because it removes traditional mechanisms for wealth accumulation among the middle class. If cognitive work automation proceeds as projected, the primary remaining economic mobility path becomes ownership of capital—specifically, ownership of AI-producing assets.

### The Inequality Amplification Mechanism

Research on AI's impact on inequality reveals multiple channels through which AI concentrates wealth:

**Income Effects**

[Brookings/GovAI research](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ais-impact-on-income-inequality-in-the-us/) shows competing dynamics: "Unlike previous waves of automation that increased both wage and wealth inequality, AI could reduce wage inequality through the displacement of high-income workers." However, this reduction in wage inequality may be offset by increased capital-labor inequality.

| Income Level | AI Exposure | Productivity Gains | Net Effect |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **\$90K/year (peak exposure)** | Highest | Concentrated here | Gain initially, displacement risk long-term |
| **Six-figure salaries** | High | Significant | Productivity boost, then potential displacement |
| **Low-wage workers** | Lower | Limited | Left behind in productivity gains |

**Capital vs. Labor Share**

[OECD analysis](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-wage-inequality_bf98a45c-en.html) warns: "In the slightly longer term, AI-driven labor automation could increase the share of income going to capital at the expense of the labor share."

This shift is critical for understanding lock-in. If AI increases returns to capital ownership while reducing returns to labor, and if AI capital ownership is highly concentrated, then wealth inequality becomes structural rather than merely distributional.

**Market Concentration Effects**

[EY analysis of GenAI economic risks](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/ai/navigate-the-economic-risks-and-challenges-of-generative-ai) identifies additional concentration mechanisms:

> "Elevated market concentration, as the GenAI market becomes increasingly dominated by a small number of large businesses, will also tend to generate higher markups and result in a growing fraction of productivity gains going to corporations. GenAI development is likely to spur greater market concentration and create 'winner takes all' business dynamics."

The mechanism: first-mover advantages, large economies of scale, and network effects lead to a "growing divide between AI leaders and laggards and the rise of 'superstar' businesses that could reap most of the GenAI benefits."

**Temporal Dynamics**

[PMC research on wealth distribution effects](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11786846/) highlights a critical temporal pattern: "Research findings highlight a temporal dichotomy in AI's effects on wealth inequality: in the short term, AI exacerbates disparities in wealth distribution, while the long-term outcomes depend on the extent of AI's influence across different technological domains."

This suggests a potential window for intervention before long-term lock-in occurs, but also indicates that early concentration effects may create path dependencies that make later reversal difficult.

### Global Inequality Dimensions

AI-driven concentration operates at multiple scales:

**International Concentration**

[Center for Global Development analysis](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/three-reasons-why-ai-may-widen-global-inequality) notes: "In 2023, the United States alone secured \$67.2 billion in AI-related private investments, which was 8.7 times more than China, the second-highest country in this regard."

This creates between-country inequality that could be more persistent than within-country inequality, as AI capabilities become essential for economic competitiveness.

**Within-Country Dynamics**

The same analysis warns: "While AI will, hopefully, boost macro-level productivity, it could widen income disparities within countries, benefiting highly skilled workers, displacing lower-skilled jobs in repetitive tasks, and concentrating wealth among those who control the technology."

## Mechanisms of Lock-in

### 1. Infrastructure Dependencies

The cloud computing oligopoly creates the first layer of lock-in:

| Provider | Market Position | Lock-in Mechanism |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **AWS** | Market leader | Proprietary APIs, data egress costs, specialized services |
| **Azure** | Second place | Enterprise integration, Microsoft ecosystem |
| **Google Cloud** | Third major player | TPU infrastructure, BigQuery ecosystem |

<Aside type="tip" title="Compute Governance as Intervention Point">
[ArXiv research on computing power governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08797) identifies compute as "a particularly effective point of intervention: it is detectable, excludable, and quantifiable, and is produced via an extremely concentrated supply chain." This suggests regulatory approaches focused on compute access could help prevent lock-in, though implementation challenges remain significant.
</Aside>

The concentration of AI compute infrastructure creates multiple lock-in dynamics:
- **Technical lock-in**: APIs, tools, and workflows become vendor-specific
- **Data gravity**: Moving large datasets prohibitively expensive
- **Performance optimization**: Models optimized for specific hardware
- **Economic lock-in**: Switching costs exceed benefit for most users

### 2. Data Monopolies and Algorithmic Control

[ArXiv research on datalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08049) identifies a new form of monopoly power: "Companies using these strategies, called 'Datalists,' are challenging existing definitions used within Monopoly Capital Theory (MCT). Datalists are pursuing a different type of monopoly control than traditional multinational corporations—specifically monopolistic control over data to feed their productive processes, increasingly controlled by algorithms and AI."

The data monopoly mechanism works through:
1. **Data accumulation**: Large platforms collect vast datasets
2. **Model improvement**: Better data → better models → more users
3. **Network effects**: More users → more data → stronger lock-in
4. **Exclusion**: Competitors cannot match data quality/quantity

### 3. Algorithmic Collusion

Emerging research documents AI systems independently engaging in anti-competitive behavior:

[ArXiv research on LLM strategic behavior](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00031v1) finds: "LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies."

[ArXiv research on AI as centripetal technology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08337) provides empirical evidence: "After gas stations in Germany adopted AI-driven pricing software, margins increased by about 28% in duopoly markets where both stations used algorithms. This suggests the algorithms were able to reach mutually beneficial pricing patterns, consistent with tacit collusion."

<Aside type="caution" title="Emergent Anti-Competitive Behavior">
The finding that AI systems can reach collusive outcomes without explicit coordination represents a novel challenge for antitrust enforcement. Traditional antitrust focuses on explicit agreements and communications; algorithmic collusion leaves no such evidence trail. This makes traditional enforcement tools potentially ineffective against AI-driven concentration.
</Aside>

### 4. Regulatory Capture and Policy Lag

[Brookings analysis on competition policy](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/google-decision-demonstrates-need-to-overhaul-competition-policy-for-ai-era/) identifies a fundamental mismatch:

> "The problem with relying solely on antitrust enforcement to address the competitive challenges of the AI era is directional. While antitrust is designed to eliminate illegal past practices, it is not a vehicle for the promotion of competition going forward."

The regulatory lag creates several vulnerabilities:

| Gap | Problem | Implication |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Temporal lag** | Antitrust addresses past harms | Lock-in occurs before intervention possible |
| **Conceptual lag** | Frameworks designed for industrial monopolies | Platform/AI dynamics not captured |
| **Enforcement lag** | Cases take 5-10 years | Market tips before remedy |
| **Global coordination lag** | Each jurisdiction acts independently | Companies play jurisdictions against each other |

---

## Causal Factors

The following factors influence economic power lock-in probability and severity. This table is designed to inform future cause-effect diagram creation.

### Primary Factors (Strong Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Frontier Model Costs** | ↑ Lock-in | leaf | Training costs \$100M-\$1B+; only ~20 orgs can compete | High |

## Intervention Mechanisms and Challenges

### Proposed Interventions

Research and policy communities have proposed several intervention strategies:

#### 1. Universal Basic Income (UBI)

<Aside type="note" title="The UBI Debate">
UBI proposals span a wide range of designs and funding mechanisms. Distinguishing between them is critical for evaluating effectiveness and identifying potential failure modes.
</Aside>

**Cost Estimates**

| UBI Design | Annual Cost | Funding Proposal | Source |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| **Yang proposal** | \$2.8-3.0T | Value-added tax, carbon tax | [Tax Foundation (2019)](https://taxproject.org/ubi-and-ai/) |
| **Poverty-level UBI** | \$8.5T | N/A | [Newsweek analysis](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-universal-basic-income-trap-yang-trump-ubi-11307379) |
| **Middle-class UBI** | \$12T | N/A | Newsweek |
| **Altman's American Equity Fund** | 2.5% of AI company/land value | Equity stakes in AI companies | [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-universal-basic-income-trap-yang-trump-ubi-11307379) |

**Tech Industry Proposals**

[Sam Altman argues](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-universal-basic-income-trap-yang-trump-ubi-11307379) that "as the marginal cost of intelligence trends toward zero, the cost of goods and services will plummet." He proposes the "American Equity Fund," where large AI companies and landholders contribute ~2.5% of their value annually to a fund distributed to all citizens.

**Critical Perspectives**

[Frontiers research on AI and UBI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11891208/) warns: "Framed merely as a token redistribution of wealth, UBI has the potential to serve as a veneer of reform, obscuring the underlying exploitation and inequity facilitated by unchecked AI expansion."

[Aestora analysis](https://www.aestora.com/essays/ai-ristorcracy) argues: "When AI leaders ask for UBI without paying sufficient tax, they are essentially asking for a direct transfer of public funds into their private bank accounts."

The critique highlights a critical failure mode: UBI funded by general taxation while AI profits remain concentrated creates a wealth transfer *to* AI companies rather than a redistribution *from* them.

#### 2. Wealth Taxation and Progressive Redistribution

Proposed mechanisms include:

| Mechanism | Targeting | Status | Challenge |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **AI-specific capital gains tax** | AI company equity | Proposed | Defining "AI company" |
| **Robot tax** | Labor automation | Proposed (Gates 2017) | Measuring displacement causally |
| **Land value tax** | AI-adjacent real estate | Proposed | Implementation complexity |
| **Progressive income tax** | High earners | Existing (weakened) | Political resistance |
| **Wealth tax** | Concentrated assets | Proposed | Enforcement, capital flight |

<Aside type="caution" title="The Alaska Permanent Fund Model">
[Analysis of Alaska's experience](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-universal-basic-income-trap-yang-trump-ubi-11307379) shows that the Permanent Fund Dividend (averaging \$1,600 annually) "has not cratered employment; a leading study finds no overall effect on full-time work." However, this represents a modest distribution from a geographically-bound resource (oil). AI capital is mobile and can relocate to avoid taxation, creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic.
</Aside>

#### 3. Antitrust and Competition Policy

[Brookings research](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/with-ai-we-need-both-competition-and-safety/) identifies tensions between competition and safety:

> "The FTC and DOJ are currently investigating whether certain transactions and collaborations between artificial intelligence (AI) companies and others violate antitrust laws. Such investigations are warranted. As a nation, we should be concerned that not only is the development of cutting-edge frontier models controlled by a handful of companies, but also that AI is adjacent to, and dependent on, already concentrated markets, such as cloud platforms and high-powered microchips."

However, the same analysis notes: "Competition and safety should not be mutually exclusive. The FTC and DOJ should make clear that collaboration on AI safety is not only allowed, but also expected."

**Trump Administration Policy Shift**

[Brookings analysis of Trump administration directions](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ai-policy-directions-in-the-new-trump-administration/) projects: "For AI, this means that acquisitions by and of AI companies that might have been blocked on antitrust grounds under a Democratic president will be more likely to proceed unimpeded. The new administration will likely relax agency regulation, focus more on competition with China, and decrease AI-related antitrust enforcement."

This suggests a potential policy inflection point where concentration accelerates due to reduced enforcement.

#### 4. Compute Governance

[ArXiv research on compute governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08797) proposes leveraging compute's detectability and excludability:

> "Policymakers could use compute to facilitate regulatory visibility of AI, allocate resources to promote beneficial outcomes, and enforce restrictions against irresponsible or malicious AI development and usage."

Proposed mechanisms include:
- **Compute allocation requirements**: Mandate access to compute for researchers, startups
- **Compute registries**: Track large-scale training runs
- **International agreements**: Coordinate compute access across jurisdictions
- **Subsidy programs**: Government-funded compute access for beneficial research

[ArXiv research on verification methods](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16074v2) suggests: "On-site inspections involve physical visits to declared data centers to verify compliance with agreements on computing power."

[ArXiv research on AI governance institutions](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.06379v1) proposes: "An International AI Agency - an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for AI. This could be backed up by a Secure Chips Agreement - a Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for AI."

#### 5. Data Sharing and Interoperability Requirements

[Brookings research on data access](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/07/31/big-tech-and-antitrust-pay-attention-to-the-math-behind-the-curtain/) argues:

> "The United States' success in the international race to develop AI would be greatly aided if the vast amounts of data hoarded by Big Tech were shared with 'Little Tech' companies pursuing their own innovative ideas."

Mechanisms could include:
- **Data portability requirements**: Users can transfer data between platforms
- **API access mandates**: Large platforms must provide access to competitors
- **Data commons**: Public repositories of training data
- **Interoperability standards**: Models can interface across platforms

### Why Interventions May Fail

Each proposed intervention faces substantial implementation challenges:

| Intervention | Primary Challenge | Lock-in Mechanism |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **UBI** | Funding at scale; political opposition | May legitimize rather than prevent concentration |
| **Wealth taxes** | Capital mobility; enforcement | Tax havens, corporate inversion |
| **Antitrust** | Backward-looking; slow process | Lock-in occurs before remedies |
| **Compute governance** | International coordination; verification | Compute is rival good (restricting access has costs) |
| **Data sharing** | Privacy concerns; competitive secrets | Data has declining marginal value (helps incumbents less) |

<Aside type="caution" title="The Irreversibility Threshold">
A critical uncertainty is identifying when concentration crosses from "concerning" to "irreversible." Once AI systems become essential infrastructure, disruption costs may exceed benefits even if concentration is recognized as problematic. This suggests interventions must occur *before* systems become embedded, but political will typically emerges only *after* harms are evident—creating a temporal mismatch that favors lock-in.
</Aside>

## Historical Parallels and Lessons

### Standard Oil and the Limits of Antitrust

The Standard Oil case (1911) established the "rule of reason" framework that continues to shape antitrust enforcement:

[Historical analysis from Yale Law School](https://energyhistory.yale.edu/antitrust-and-monopoly/) documents: "At the beginning of the 20th century Standard Oil Co. was one of the world's largest and most powerful corporations and its chairman, John D. Rockefeller, was the first billionaire. The Standard Oil Trust grew to control around ninety percent of the refined oil in the United States."

The Supreme Court ordered Standard Oil broken into 39 independent companies (including predecessors to Exxon, Mobil, Chevron). However, [analysis of the decision's legacy](https://jpt.spe.org/twa/the-antitrust-legacy-of-standard-oil-in-todays-world) notes critical limitations:

> "Standard Oil introduced a principle by which subsequent antitrust actions have been weighed: the 'rule of reason.' This principle holds that business practices are only anticompetitive if they work against the public interest. The 'rule of reason' used to measure Standard Oil has failed to flag Big Tech as monopolistic, despite clear dominance in various market sectors."

The reason: "Many services are provided free to consumers in return for advertising and data utilization, consumers are not being harmed by artificially inflated prices."

**The Platform Economics Gap**

Standard Oil's monopoly operated through control of physical infrastructure (pipelines, refineries) and vertical integration. The antitrust remedy—breaking up the company—worked because the separated entities could operate independently.

AI lock-in operates differently:
1. **Network effects**: Value increases with user base (breaking up reduces value)
2. **Data feedback loops**: Historical data cannot be redistributed
3. **Returns to scale**: Smaller entities less competitive
4. **Infrastructure dependencies**: Separated entities still depend on same cloud providers

[Yale Law Journal analysis](https://yalelawjournal.org/article/antitrust-and-platform-monopoly) notes: "Breaking up large firms subject to extensive scale economies or positive network effects is generally unwise. The resulting entities will be unable to behave competitively. Inevitably, they will either merge or collude, or else one will drive the others out of business."

### Railroad Monopolies and Infrastructure Control

Progressive-era railroad regulation offers another historical parallel:

[Historical analysis](https://energyhistory.yale.edu/antitrust-and-monopoly/) documents: "Reformers viewed choke points in the system, such as railroad lines, pipelines, and telephone and telegraph lines, as particularly problematic and in need of legislative oversight."

The regulatory response included:
- **1903 Elkins Act**: Barred railroad rebates
- **1906 Hepburn Act**: Empowered agencies to set "just and reasonable" rates
- **1914 Clayton Act**: Expanded review of anti-competitive mergers

This suggests a regulatory model distinct from antitrust: treating essential infrastructure as requiring direct oversight rather than relying on market competition.

**Applying to AI Infrastructure**

Cloud computing and foundation models may constitute essential infrastructure requiring similar treatment:
- **Rate regulation**: Limits on compute pricing, model API costs
- **Access requirements**: Mandate access for researchers, competitors
- **Interoperability standards**: Ensure portability across providers
- **Capacity allocation**: Public interest quotas for compute resources

However, infrastructure regulation also has limitations:
- **Regulatory capture**: Incumbents influence regulators
- **Innovation reduction**: Rate regulation reduces investment incentives
- **Global coordination**: Infrastructure regulation typically national; AI is global

## Open Questions

<Aside type="note" title="Key Uncertainties">
These questions represent the highest-value areas for follow-up research and policy development.
</Aside>

| Question | Why It Matters | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **What defines the irreversibility threshold?** | Need to know when intervention becomes impossible | Theoretical models exist; no empirical validation |
| **Can open source models prevent lock-in?** | Open models could provide competitive pressure | Currently lag frontier by 6-18 months; sustainability unclear |
| **How does international competition affect concentration?** | US-China rivalry may accelerate or prevent domestic concentration | Mixed evidence; coordination problems |
| **Will compute costs decline enough to commoditize AI?** | If training becomes affordable, concentration pressure reduces | Current trend is escalating costs; inference costs declining |
| **Can UBI be funded at scale without accelerating concentration?** | Funding mechanism critical to net effect | Most proposals lack credible funding; Alaska model non-scalable |
| **Do natural monopoly characteristics persist as AI matures?** | If temporary, concentration self-corrects | Foundation models exhibit natural monopoly; unclear if permanent |
| **How do AI safety and competition interact?** | Safety requirements may increase fixed costs → more concentration | Active policy debate; no consensus |
| **What triggers political will for intervention?** | Need to understand conditions for policy change | Historical precedent suggests crisis required; may be too late |

## AI Transition Model Context

<Aside type="tip" title="Model Integration">
This research connects to multiple factors in the AI Transition Model. Economic power lock-in represents a long-term trajectory failure mode where civilizational competence proves insufficient to maintain equitable distribution of AI benefits. The mechanisms identified—data feedback loops, infrastructure dependencies, labor displacement—represent specific causal pathways through which AI capabilities lead to concentrated economic power.
</Aside>

### Connections to Other Model Elements

| Model Element | Relationship to Economic Lock-in |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **AI Capabilities (Algorithms)** | Increasing returns to scale in model development → concentration |
| **AI Capabilities (Compute)** | Compute costs create barrier to entry; cloud oligopoly enables lock-in |
| **AI Capabilities (Adoption)** | Rapid adoption before regulatory frameworks → path dependency |
| **AI Ownership (Companies)** | Small number of frontier labs control key capabilities |
| **AI Ownership (Countries)** | US dominance (94% of funding) creates international inequality |
| **AI Uses (Industries)** | Labor displacement removes traditional economic mobility paths |
| **AI Uses (Coordination)** | Algorithmic collusion reduces competition without explicit coordination |
| **Civilizational Competence (Governance)** | Regulatory lag and conceptual gaps enable concentration |
| **Civilizational Competence (Adaptability)** | Skills mismatch (77% new jobs need master's degrees) limits adaptation |
| **Transition Turbulence (Economic Stability)** | 76,440 jobs eliminated (2025); white-collar recession emerging |
| **Long-term Lock-in (Political Power)** | Economic concentration enables political influence → policy capture |
| **Long-term Lock-in (Values)** | Economic hierarchy embeds values of those controlling AI capital |

### Key Insights for the Model

1. **Economic lock-in may occur with low turbulence**: Unlike catastrophic scenarios, economic concentration can proceed gradually while appearing beneficial at each step. This makes it harder to generate intervention momentum.

2. **Irreversibility threshold is uncertain but critical**: Once AI systems become essential infrastructure and concentration reaches certain levels, reversal may become structurally impossible rather than merely politically difficult.

3. **Multiple reinforcing mechanisms**: Data feedback loops, infrastructure dependencies, returns to scale, and regulatory lag create mutually reinforcing dynamics that accelerate concentration.

4. **Historical antitrust frameworks inadequate**: Standard Oil precedent and "rule of reason" doctrine designed for industrial monopolies fail to address platform economics, natural monopoly characteristics, and algorithmic collusion.

5. **Intervention window may be closing**: Current concentration trends (four companies controlling 66.7% of market value, labor displacement accelerating, compute costs escalating) suggest we are in early stages of lock-in. Each year of delayed intervention increases reversal difficulty.

6. **International coordination essential**: AI capital mobility and global markets mean unilateral interventions face race-to-the-bottom dynamics. Effective responses require international coordination similar to climate agreements.

The research suggests economic power lock-in should be considered a high-probability failure mode that receives insufficient attention because each step appears reasonable and beneficial. The challenge for governance is developing interventions that can be implemented *before* lock-in while political will typically emerges only *after* harms are evident.

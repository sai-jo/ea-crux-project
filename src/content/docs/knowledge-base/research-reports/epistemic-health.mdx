## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Trust collapse** | 30-50% decline since 2000 | Authority undermined |
| **Verification harder** | AI content indistinguishable | Truth harder to establish |
| **Attention fragmented** | Average engagement declining | Deep thought harder |
| **Polarization rising** | Shared facts declining | Consensus harder |
| **AI dual role** | Can help or hurt | Design choices matter |

## Research Summary

Epistemic health refers to a society's collective ability to form accurate beliefs, update on evidence, distinguish truth from falsehood, and make well-informed decisions. This is foundational to all other societal functions: effective governance, scientific progress, economic coordination, and social trust all depend on epistemic health. Poor epistemic health means societies make worse decisions across all domains.

Multiple trends are degrading epistemic health. Trust in traditional information authorities has declined dramatically since 2000. The volume of information has overwhelmed human processing capacity, leading to shallow engagement and easy manipulation. Social media has created epistemic bubbles where contrary evidence never penetrates. And AI is making it easier to generate convincing false content while harder to verify authentic content.

AI's role is dual: it threatens epistemic health through disinformation capabilities and manipulation potential, but could also improve it through better information synthesis, fact-checking, and knowledge accessibility. The net effect depends on design choices, business models, and governance frameworks that are being decided now.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Epistemic Health Matters">
Every other parameter and factor depends on epistemic health. We can't govern AI, coordinate on safety, or make good decisions about anything if we can't distinguish truth from falsehood.
</Aside>

### Epistemic Health Components

| Component | Description | Current State |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Information quality** | Accuracy of available info | Declining |
| **Trust** | Confidence in sources | Declining |
| **Processing capacity** | Ability to evaluate | Overwhelmed |
| **Shared reality** | Common facts | Fragmenting |
| **Update ability** | Change views on evidence | Weak |

### Historical Comparison

| Era | Information | Trust | Processing | Shared Reality |
|-----|-------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Print** | Limited, gatekept | High in authorities | Manageable | High |
| **Broadcast** | Centralized | Moderate | Manageable | High |
| **Early internet** | Decentralized | Moderate | Challenging | Fragmenting |
| **Social media** | Overwhelming | Low | Overwhelmed | Fragmented |
| **AI era** | Synthetic + overwhelming | Very low | Impossible | Very fragmented |

## Key Findings

### Trust Trends

| Institution | 2000 Level | 2024 Level | Change |
|-------------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Media** | 55% | 32% | -42% |
| **Science** | 45% high confidence | 35% | -22% |
| **Government** | 44% | 22% | -50% |
| **Each other** | 35% | 30% | -14% |

<Aside type="caution" title="Trust Is Hard to Rebuild">
Trust can be lost quickly but takes generations to rebuild. Current trust levels may constrain what's possible in AI governance for decades.
</Aside>

### Information Environment

| Metric | 2010 | 2024 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Daily information exposure** | 5-10 GB | 50-100 GB | +10x |
| **Average content engagement** | Minutes | Seconds | -10x |
| **Fact-check lag** | Hours | Days | Worse |
| **Synthetic content %** | <1% | 10-20%+ | Growing rapidly |

### Attention and Processing

| Finding | Data | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Average attention span** | 8.25 seconds | Microsoft study |
| **Deep reading decline** | 30-40% less | Multiple studies |
| **Source checking** | <20% verify sources | Surveys |
| **Headline-only reading** | 60%+ of shares | Social media data |

### Polarization Metrics

| Measure | Trend | Evidence |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Political polarization** | Increasing | Pew data |
| **Epistemic polarization** | Increasing | Shared fact agreement |
| **Media diet divergence** | Increasing | Consumption patterns |
| **Cross-cutting exposure** | Decreasing | Social network analysis |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Degrading Epistemic Health

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Information volume** | Exceeds processing capacity | Increasing |
| **AI content generation** | Cheap synthetic content | Accelerating |
| **Business models** | Engagement > truth | Persistent |
| **Polarization incentives** | Outrage = clicks | Persistent |
| **Complexity** | World too complex to understand | Increasing |

### Factors That Could Improve Epistemic Health

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **AI verification** | Detect false content | Arms race |
| **AI synthesis** | Help process information | Available |
| **Provenance systems** | Track content origin | Emerging |
| **Media literacy** | Better information consumers | Limited |
| **Business model reform** | Not engagement-based | Very limited |

## AI's Dual Role

### AI Threats to Epistemic Health

| Threat | Mechanism | Current Scale |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Disinformation** | Cheap false content | Large and growing |
| **Deepfakes** | Fake video/audio | Millions of examples |
| **Personalized manipulation** | Targeted persuasion | Widespread |
| **Bot activity** | Fake social engagement | 15-30% of social media |
| **Authenticity erosion** | Nothing can be trusted | Growing concern |

### AI Opportunities for Epistemic Health

| Opportunity | Mechanism | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Fact-checking** | Automated verification | Some deployment |
| **Synthesis** | Summarize complex topics | Available |
| **Translation** | Bridge languages/communities | Available |
| **Detection** | Identify synthetic content | Limited |
| **Provenance** | Verify content origin | Emerging |

<Aside type="note" title="The Arms Race">
AI is both the cause of and potential solution to epistemic challenges. Whether AI helps or hurts epistemic health depends on which uses dominate—and currently offensive uses have advantages.

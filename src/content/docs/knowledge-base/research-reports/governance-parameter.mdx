## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Frameworks emerging** | EU AI Act, US EO, China rules | Some structure |
| **Enforcement weak** | Limited capacity, unclear jurisdiction | Rules unenforced |
| **Fragmentation high** | No unified approach | Gaps and conflicts |
| **Speed mismatch** | Regulation years, AI months | Always behind |
| **Expertise gap** | 10-100x fewer experts in government | Can't evaluate |

## Research Summary

Governance as a parameter measures society's capacity to effectively regulate, steer, and oversee AI development. This includes the formal legal frameworks that establish rules, the institutional capacity to monitor compliance, the enforcement mechanisms to address violations, and the adaptive processes to update rules as technology changes.

Current AI governance is emerging but inadequate. The EU AI Act represents the most comprehensive framework but implementation faces challenges. The US relies on sector-specific regulation and executive action. China has moved quickly on specific AI applications but with different priorities. International coordination is minimal. And across jurisdictions, the gap between regulatory ambition and enforcement capacity is large.

The fundamental challenge is that governance evolves slowly while AI evolves rapidly. Building regulatory capacity requires expertise, resources, and political will that accumulate over years or decades. AI capabilities advance in months. This mismatch means governance is perpetually behind—regulating yesterday's AI while tomorrow's AI is being developed.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Governance Capacity Matters">
Even well-designed AI policies fail without governance capacity to implement them. Governance is the practical ability to translate intentions into outcomes—and it's severely limited for AI.
</Aside>

### Governance Components

| Component | Description | Current Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Legal frameworks** | Laws and regulations | Emerging |
| **Regulatory capacity** | Staff, expertise, resources | Very limited |
| **Enforcement mechanisms** | Penalties, monitoring | Weak |
| **Adaptive processes** | Updating rules | Slow |
| **International coordination** | Cross-border governance | Minimal |

### Governance Approaches

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Horizontal regulation** | Rules for all AI | EU AI Act |
| **Sector-specific** | Rules for domains | FDA for medical AI |
| **Self-regulation** | Industry governance | Voluntary commitments |
| **Standards-based** | Technical requirements | NIST AI RMF |
| **Liability** | Ex post accountability | Product liability |

## Key Findings

### Current Regulatory Landscape

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Status | Enforcement |
|--------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **EU** | AI Act | Implementing | Building |
| **US** | Executive Order, sector rules | Fragmented | Limited |
| **China** | Algorithm, generative AI rules | Active | State capacity |
| **UK** | Pro-innovation approach | Developing | Sector-based |
| **International** | No binding rules | Minimal | None |

<Aside type="caution" title="Fragmented Landscape">
AI governance is fragmented across jurisdictions with different approaches, different definitions, and different enforcement. This creates regulatory arbitrage and coordination challenges.
</Aside>

### Capacity Assessment

| Dimension | Global Capacity | Need |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| **AI experts in government** | ~1,000-2,000 | 10,000+ |
| **Dedicated AI regulators** | ~500 | 5,000+ |
| **Government AI compute** | Minimal | Significant |
| **International coordinators** | Dozens | Hundreds |
| **Enforcement staff** | Very limited | Substantial |

### Speed Comparison

| Process | Typical Duration | AI Equivalent |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **Major legislation** | 3-7 years | Multiple model generations |
| **Agency rulemaking** | 1-3 years | Capability doublings |
| **International treaty** | 5-15 years | Transformative advances |
| **Court decisions** | 2-5 years | Major shifts |

### Governance Gaps

| Gap | Description | Severity |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **Frontier models** | Most capable systems unregulated | Critical |
| **International** | No cross-border coordination | High |
| **Open source** | Can't regulate released models | High |
| **Dual-use** | Same tech, different uses | Moderate |
| **Enforcement** | Can't verify compliance | High |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Governance

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Complexity** | AI hard to understand | Increasing |
| **Speed** | Change outpaces regulation | Accelerating |
| **Expertise gap** | Government lacks knowledge | Persistent |
| **Industry power** | Resources for lobbying | Strong |
| **Jurisdictional limits** | AI crosses borders | Structural |

### Factors That Could Strengthen Governance

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Investment** | More resources for regulators | Growing |
| **AI Safety Institutes** | Build technical capacity | Emerging |
| **Crisis events** | Incidents motivate action | Pending |
| **International cooperation** | Coordinate approaches | Early |
| **AI assistance** | Use AI to regulate AI | Experimental |

## Governance Models

### Current Models in Practice

| Model | Description | Effectiveness |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Risk-based** | Regulate by risk level | EU approach |
| **Principles-based** | Flexible guidelines | UK approach |
| **Sector-specific** | Domain regulators | US approach |
| **State-directed** | Government control | China approach |
| **Industry self-regulation** | Voluntary commitments | Dominant globally |

### Emerging Approaches

| Approach | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Compute governance** | Regulate via hardware | Proposed |
| **Liability expansion** | Increase accountability | Debated |
| **Licensing regimes** | Require approval | Proposed |
| **International regimes** | Treaty-based | Discussed |
| **Auditing requirements** | Independent assessment | Early |

<Aside type="note" title="No Proven Model">
There is no established model for governing rapidly-advancing technology with global reach. AI governance is experimental—we're inventing approaches while the technology evolves.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Automation increasing** | AI makes more decisions | Humans less involved |
| **Dependency growing** | Reliance on AI systems | Skills atrophying |
| **Manipulation capability** | AI can influence preferences | Authenticity threatened |
| **Awareness low** | Most don't notice agency loss | No pressure to address |
| **Design choices matter** | AI can augment or replace | Not inevitable |

## Research Summary

Human agency—the capacity to make meaningful choices, act on one's own values, and influence outcomes—is foundational to human flourishing and democratic governance. AI systems increasingly affect this agency, sometimes enhancing it (by providing information and capabilities) but often eroding it (by automating decisions, creating dependency, and manipulating preferences).

Agency erosion occurs through multiple mechanisms. Automated recommendation systems make choices for users (what to read, buy, watch) that users experience as their own preferences. Decision support systems in high-stakes domains (medicine, law, hiring) can become decision-making systems when humans routinely defer to AI outputs. Personalized manipulation can shape preferences themselves, undermining the authenticity of human choices.

The challenge is that agency erosion often feels convenient rather than threatening. Users appreciate AI systems that reduce cognitive load and make decisions easier. But the cumulative effect may be humans who are less capable of independent thought, more dependent on AI systems, and whose preferences are increasingly shaped by AI rather than authentic reflection.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Agency Matters">
Agency is not just about individual autonomy—it's about whether humans collectively shape their future or become passive participants in a trajectory determined by AI systems and their designers.
</Aside>

### Components of Agency

| Component | Description | AI Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Choice** | Ability to decide | Automated by AI |
| **Capability** | Ability to act | Enhanced or atrophied |
| **Authenticity** | Values are one's own | Potentially manipulated |
| **Understanding** | Comprehend situation | Obscured by complexity |
| **Influence** | Shape outcomes | Concentrated in AI controllers |

### Agency Contexts

| Context | Description | Current State |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Consumer** | Purchasing, content choices | Heavily mediated by AI |
| **Professional** | Work decisions | Increasingly AI-assisted |
| **Political** | Civic participation | AI-influenced information |
| **Personal** | Life choices | Growing AI involvement |
| **Collective** | Societal direction | AI may dominate |

## Key Findings

### Decision Automation

| Domain | % Decisions AI-Influenced | Trend |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Content consumption** | 70-90% (via recommendation) | Increasing |
| **Online shopping** | 50-70% (via recommendation) | Increasing |
| **Navigation** | 80%+ use AI routing | Dominant |
| **Professional** | 30-50% AI-assisted | Growing rapidly |
| **Healthcare** | 20-30% AI-assisted | Growing |

<Aside type="caution" title="Invisible Influence">
Most AI influence on decisions is invisible to users. People may believe they're making independent choices when they're following AI recommendations.
</Aside>

### Capability Effects

| Effect | Mechanism | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Skill atrophy** | Less practice reduces ability | Navigation, writing, math |
| **Learned helplessness** | Defer to AI | Professional domains |
| **Knowledge loss** | Don't learn what AI knows | Multiple domains |
| **Creative limitation** | AI shapes possibility space | Art, design |

### Manipulation Capability

| Technique | Mechanism | Deployment |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Personalized persuasion** | Tailored to individual psychology | Common |
| **Attention capture** | Maximize engagement | Universal |
| **Preference shaping** | Repeated exposure creates preference | Common |
| **Choice architecture** | Design choices to steer | Universal |
| **Emotional manipulation** | Target emotional responses | Growing |

### Dependency Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Risk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Functional dependency** | Can't function without AI | Resilience loss |
| **Cognitive dependency** | Don't think independently | Critical thinking loss |
| **Emotional dependency** | AI relationships replace human | Social atrophy |
| **Economic dependency** | Livelihood requires AI | Vulnerability |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Eroding Agency

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Convenience preference** | AI reduces cognitive load | Persistent |
| **Capability growth** | AI better than humans | Accelerating |
| **Business models** | Engagement = revenue | Persistent |
| **Competition** | Must use AI to compete | Intensifying |
| **Complexity** | World too complex without AI | Increasing |

### Factors That Could Preserve Agency

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Augmentation focus** | Design AI to enhance human capability | Some adoption |
| **Transparency requirements** | Know when AI is involved | Limited regulation |
| **Right to human decision** | Preserve human-only options | Emerging discussion |
| **Digital literacy** | Understand AI influence | Limited education |
| **Value articulation** | Societies decide what agency means | Early discussion |

## Design Choices

### AI as Augmentation

| Approach | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Explain, don't decide** | AI provides info, human decides | Decision support |
| **Maintain skills** | Require human practice | Pilot training |
| **Expand options** | Show more, not less | Full search results |
| **Support reflection** | Help humans think | Structured deliberation |

### AI as Replacement

| Approach | Mechanism | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Full automation** | AI decides without human | Agency loss |
| **Dark patterns** | Manipulate toward preferred choice | Authenticity loss |
| **Filter bubbles** | Limit information | Understanding loss |
| **Dependency creation** | Make human performance impossible | Capability loss |

<Aside type="note" title="Not Inevitable">
Agency erosion isn't a necessary consequence of AI capability. It's a design choice. AI can be built to enhance human capability and support human decision-making rather than replace it.

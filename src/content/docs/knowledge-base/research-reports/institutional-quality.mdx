## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Quality varies** | Countries score 20-95 on governance indices | Uneven capability |
| **Building is slow** | Decades to build strong institutions | Can't create fast |
| **AI stress tests** | Rapid change overwhelms institutions | Adaptation crisis |
| **Technical gap** | AI requires technical capacity | Most lack it |
| **Reform difficult** | Vested interests resist change | Path dependency |

## Research Summary

Institutional quality—the effectiveness, legitimacy, and adaptability of organizations that govern society—is a fundamental constraint on AI governance. High-quality institutions can monitor AI development, enforce regulations, adapt to new challenges, and maintain public trust. Low-quality institutions fail at all of these tasks, regardless of how well-designed their formal rules are.

Current institutional quality for AI governance is inadequate. Most government agencies lack technical expertise to understand AI systems. Existing regulatory frameworks were designed for slower-changing technologies. International institutions have minimal capacity for AI coordination. And the institutions that do exist face trust deficits that undermine their legitimacy.

The challenge is that building high-quality institutions takes time—typically decades. The institutions that successfully govern finance, aviation, or nuclear power developed over many years through trial, error, and gradual accumulation of expertise and legitimacy. AI may not allow for this traditional timeline. The question is whether institutional development can be accelerated, or whether AI governance will operate with inadequate institutions for critical years.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Institutional Quality Matters">
Good rules require good institutions to implement them. The best-designed AI regulations fail if enforcement agencies lack capacity. The most sophisticated governance approaches fail if institutions lack legitimacy.
</Aside>

### Components of Institutional Quality

| Component | Description | AI Relevance |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Effectiveness** | Achieve stated goals | Implement regulations |
| **Legitimacy** | Accepted as authoritative | Public compliance |
| **Adaptability** | Respond to change | Keep pace with AI |
| **Expertise** | Technical knowledge | Understand AI systems |
| **Independence** | Resist capture | Avoid industry control |

### Institutional Types for AI

| Type | Examples | Current Status |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Regulators** | AI Safety Institutes, AI Office | Building |
| **Standards bodies** | NIST, ISO | Active |
| **International** | UN bodies, treaties | Minimal |
| **Courts** | Legal system | Adapting |
| **Oversight** | Congress, Parliament | Limited expertise |

## Key Findings

### Global Institutional Quality

| Region | Governance Index | AI Governance Capacity |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Nordic countries** | 85-95 | Moderate |
| **Western Europe** | 75-85 | Building |
| **North America** | 70-80 | Building |
| **East Asia** | 50-80 | Variable |
| **Global South** | 20-60 | Very Limited |

<Aside type="caution" title="Quality Inequality">
Institutional quality varies enormously across countries. AI governance requires coordination across this uneven landscape, meaning the weakest institutions constrain global governance.
</Aside>

### AI-Specific Institutional Capacity

| Dimension | Current State | Need |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| **Technical expertise** | Very limited | Critical |
| **Regulatory frameworks** | Nascent | Essential |
| **Enforcement capacity** | Minimal | Important |
| **International coordination** | Weak | Critical |
| **Adaptive capacity** | Limited | Essential |

### Sector Comparison

| Sector | Institutional Maturity | Lessons for AI |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Finance** | High | Strong regulators, slow adaptation |
| **Aviation** | High | Safety culture, international standards |
| **Nuclear** | High | Technical expertise, international bodies |
| **Pharmaceuticals** | High | Testing regimes, liability |
| **Internet** | Low | Self-regulation limits, catch-up regulation |

### Institution Building Timeline

| Institution Type | Development Time | AI Status |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **National regulator** | 10-20 years | 1-3 years in |
| **International treaty** | 5-15 years | Not started |
| **Professional norms** | 20-30 years | Early |
| **Legal frameworks** | 10-30 years | Nascent |
| **Public trust** | Decades | Not established |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Institutional Quality

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Speed mismatch** | Institutions slow, AI fast | Worsening |
| **Technical complexity** | Hard to understand AI | Persistent |
| **Resource constraints** | Limited budgets | Persistent |
| **Political polarization** | Can't build consensus | Continuing |
| **Capture risk** | Industry influences regulators | Persistent |

### Factors That Could Improve Quality

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Investment** | More resources for institutions | Growing |
| **Expert recruitment** | Bring AI expertise to government | Difficult |
| **International cooperation** | Share capacity | Early |
| **Crisis motivation** | Incidents drive reform | Waiting |
| **AI assistance** | Use AI in governance | Experimental |

## Institutional Challenges for AI

### Technical Capacity Gap

| Challenge | Description | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Understanding AI** | Regulators don't know AI | High |
| **Evaluation capability** | Can't assess systems | High |
| **Monitoring** | Can't track compliance | High |
| **Forecasting** | Can't anticipate change | Moderate |

### Legitimacy Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Democratic deficit** | Public not consulted | Moderate |
| **Industry capture** | Perceived conflicts | High |
| **Trust deficit** | Low institutional trust | Moderate |
| **International legitimacy** | Who speaks for world? | High |

### Adaptability Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Bureaucratic inertia** | Slow to change | High |
| **Legal constraints** | Rules limit flexibility | Moderate |
| **Political gridlock** | Can't update laws | Variable |
| **Path dependency** | Locked into old approaches | Moderate |

<Aside type="note" title="Institution Building Is Slow">
Strong institutions develop through decades of learning, trust-building, and accumulation of expertise. AI may require institutional capacity faster than it can be built through normal processes.

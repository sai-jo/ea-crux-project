## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | <1% of computation understood | Mostly black boxes |
| **Technique progress** | Incremental but real | Some tools available |
| **Scaling challenge** | Harder with larger models | May not keep pace |
| **Safety relevance** | Critical for verification | Can't verify alignment without it |
| **Investment** | Growing but small | Underfunded relative to importance |

## Research Summary

Interpretability research aims to understand how AI systems work internally—what features they represent, how they process information, and why they produce particular outputs. This understanding is potentially essential for AI safety: without interpretability, we cannot verify that systems are aligned, detect deceptive behaviors, or predict how systems will behave in new situations.

Current interpretability coverage is very limited. Despite significant research progress, we can explain only a tiny fraction of what happens inside large neural networks. Techniques like probing classifiers, attention visualization, sparse autoencoders, and activation patching provide partial insights, but fall far short of comprehensive understanding. Most of what frontier models compute remains opaque.

The field faces a fundamental scaling challenge. As models grow larger and more capable, interpretability becomes harder: there are more features to understand, more complex interactions, and behaviors that may be distributed across the network in ways that resist simple analysis. Whether interpretability research can keep pace with capability growth is a critical uncertainty for AI safety.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Interpretability Matters">
If we can't understand how AI systems work, we can't verify they're safe. Interpretability is the difference between trusting AI behavior and understanding AI cognition.

### Interpretability Goals

| Goal | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Mechanistic understanding** | Know how models compute | Very limited |
| **Feature identification** | Know what models represent | Partial |
| **Behavior prediction** | Anticipate outputs | Limited |
| **Alignment verification** | Confirm goals match intent | Not achievable |
| **Deception detection** | Identify hidden goals | Very limited |

### Interpretability Levels

| Level | Description | Current Coverage |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Input-output** | Map inputs to outputs | High |
| **Attention patterns** | See what attends to what | Moderate |
| **Feature activation** | Know when features fire | Some |

## Key Findings

### Current Techniques

| Technique | What It Reveals | Limitations |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Probing classifiers** | Encoded features | Correlational, not causal |
| **Attention visualization** | Attention patterns | Doesn't explain reasoning |
| **Activation patching** | Causal importance | One feature at a time |
| **Sparse autoencoders** | Decomposed features | Incomplete coverage |
| **Circuit analysis** | Small computation paths | Doesn't scale |

<Aside type="caution" title="The Interpretation Gap">
We have many tools that provide partial insights, but no technique gives comprehensive understanding. The gap between what we can interpret and what models compute remains vast.
</Aside>

### Coverage Estimates

| Model Component | Interpretation Coverage | Confidence |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Input embedding** | Moderate | High |
| **Early layers** | Low-Moderate | Moderate |
| **Middle layers** | Very Low | Low |
| **Later layers** | Low | Moderate |
| **Full model** | <1% | High |

### Research Progress

### Scaling Challenges

| Challenge | Mechanism | Severity |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Feature proliferation** | More features to understand | High |
| **Polysemanticity** | Features mean multiple things | High |
| **Distributed computation** | No single location for concepts | High |
| **Superposition** | Multiple features per dimension | High |
| **Compositional complexity** | Features combine in complex ways | High |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Coverage

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Model scale** | Larger models harder to interpret | Growing challenge |
| **Fundamental complexity** | Neural nets are genuinely complex | Inherent |
| **Tool limitations** | Current techniques don't scale | Ongoing |
| **Polysemanticity** | Multiple meanings per neuron | Fundamental |
| **Investment gap** | Less funding than capabilities | Persistent |

### Factors That Could Improve Coverage

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|

| **Automated interpretability** | AI helps interpret AI | Emerging |
| **Architectural changes** | Design more interpretable models | Limited adoption |
| **Scaling laws for interpretability** | Understand how coverage scales | Not yet discovered |

## Safety Implications

### What Interpretability Could Enable

| Capability | Mechanism | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Alignment verification** | See if goals match | Not achievable |
| **Deception detection** | Identify hidden goals | Very limited |
| **Prediction improvement** | Better anticipate behavior | Limited |
| **Targeted intervention** | Fix specific problems | Some success |
| **Trust building** | Understand before deploy | Not sufficient |

### Current Limitations for Safety

| Limitation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **Can't see goals** | Can't verify alignment |
| **Can't predict failures** | Surprised by behaviors |
| **Can't detect deception** | May be fooled |
| **Can't guarantee safety** | No verification possible |

<Aside type="note" title="The Verification Problem">
Without interpretability, we rely on behavioral testing for safety—but behavioral testing can't catch a model that's only deceptive when not being tested. True safety verification may require true interpretability.

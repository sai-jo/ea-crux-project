## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **High variance** | Safety investment ranges 5-20%+ across labs | Inconsistent protection |
| **RSPs adopted** | Major labs have responsible scaling policies | Framework exists |
| **Enforcement weak** | Self-governance, limited external audit | Commitments may not hold |
| **Competitive pressure** | Racing dynamics threaten safety investment | Economic incentives misaligned |
| **Talent concentration** | Top safety researchers at few labs | Limited diversity of approaches |

## Research Summary

AI lab safety practices represent a critical factor in whether advanced AI development proceeds safely. The major frontier AI labs—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta—have developed increasingly sophisticated safety frameworks, including Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs), red teaming programs, and dangerous capability evaluations. Anthropic allocates approximately 20% of its workforce to safety research, while other labs report lower but still substantial investments.

However, significant concerns remain. Safety practices vary widely across labs, with some newer or less well-resourced organizations investing far less in safety measures. The enforcement of safety commitments relies primarily on self-governance, with limited external verification or accountability mechanisms. The 2023 departure of several safety-focused researchers from OpenAI highlighted tensions between safety priorities and commercial pressures. Additionally, the concentration of safety expertise at a few major labs creates risks if those organizations fail.

Competitive dynamics pose perhaps the greatest threat to safety investment. Labs face pressure to deploy capabilities quickly to maintain market position, creating incentives to reduce safety testing and evaluation periods. While major labs have publicly committed to safety-first approaches, the economic incentives push toward speed. International coordination remains limited, with labs in different jurisdictions facing different regulatory pressures and norms.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Lab Practices Matter">
AI lab safety practices determine whether dangerous capabilities are identified and mitigated before deployment. Good practices provide crucial protection; poor practices create risk at the point of maximum leverage.
</Aside>

### Evolution of Lab Safety

| Period | Practices | Sophistication |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Pre-2020** | Ad hoc safety research | Low |
| **2020-2022** | Dedicated safety teams, alignment research | Medium |
| **2022-2023** | Red teaming, capability evaluations | Medium-High |
| **2023-present** | RSPs, external audits, structured governance | High (at leading labs) |

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Responsible Scaling Policy** | Capability thresholds triggering safety measures |
| **Red teaming** | Adversarial testing for harmful capabilities |
| **Dangerous capability evals** | Testing for CBRN, cyber, deception |
| **Alignment research** | Long-term safety research programs |
| **Model audits** | Internal and external review |

## Key Findings

### Safety Investment by Lab

| Lab | Safety Team Size | % of Workforce | Key Focus Areas |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Anthropic** | 50-100+ | ~20% | Constitutional AI, interpretability, alignment |
| **Google DeepMind** | 100+ | ~10-15% | Scalable oversight, robustness |
| **OpenAI** | 30-50 | ~5-10% | Alignment, governance (reduced after departures) |
| **Meta** | 20-40 | ~3-5% | Responsible AI, bias |

<Aside type="caution" title="Measurement Challenges">
These estimates are approximate. Labs define "safety" differently, and some count policy/governance work while others focus on technical safety research.
</Aside>

### Responsible Scaling Policies

| Lab | RSP Name | Key Thresholds | Enforcement |
|-----|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Anthropic** | Responsible Scaling Policy | ASL levels 2-5 | Internal + commitments |
| **OpenAI** | Preparedness Framework | Capability categories | Internal review |
| **Google DeepMind** | Frontier Safety Framework | Capability thresholds | Internal + board |
| **Microsoft** | Responsible AI Standard | Risk categories | Internal governance |

### Red Teaming and Evaluation

| Practice | Adoption Rate | Rigor |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Internal red teaming** | Universal at frontier labs | Varies |
| **External red teaming** | Major labs | Moderate |
| **Dangerous capability evals** | Spreading | Developing methodology |
| **Third-party audits** | Limited | Low coverage |
| **Pre-deployment testing** | Universal | Varies in depth |

### Reported Safety Incidents

| Year | Incident | Lab | Response |
|------|----------|-----|----------|
| **2023** | Safety team departures | OpenAI | Leadership changes |
| **2024** | Alignment faking discovered | Anthropic | Published research, continued work |
| **2024** | Scheming evaluations positive | Multiple | Mitigation research initiated |
| **2025** | Sycophancy rollback | OpenAI | Model adjustment |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Supporting Safety

| Factor | Mechanism | Strength |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Founder values** | Personal commitment to safety | Strong at some labs |
| **Reputational risk** | Brand damage from failures | Medium |
| **Regulatory pressure** | EU AI Act, potential US rules | Increasing |
| **Talent preferences** | Top researchers prefer safety-conscious labs | Medium |
| **Long-term thinking** | Existential risk awareness | Strong at some labs |

### Factors Undermining Safety

| Factor | Mechanism | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Competitive pressure** | Speed-to-market incentives | High |
| **Revenue pressure** | Investor expectations | High |
| **Talent poaching** | Safety researchers recruited away | Medium |
| **Capability excitement** | Focus on what models can do | Medium |
| **Enforcement gaps** | No external accountability | High |

## Governance Mechanisms

### Internal Governance

| Mechanism | Description | Effectiveness |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Safety review boards** | Internal oversight of risky capabilities | Varies |
| **Publication review** | Screen for dangerous information | Standard |
| **Deployment gates** | Approval required for releases | Improving |
| **Incident response** | Procedures for safety failures | Developing |

### External Governance

| Mechanism | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Third-party audits** | Independent safety evaluation | Limited adoption |
| **Government oversight** | Regulatory requirements | EU AI Act; US limited |
| **Industry coordination** | Shared standards and practices | Frontier Model Forum |
| **Public commitments** | Voluntary pledges | Bletchley, Seoul declarations |

<Aside type="note" title="The Enforcement Gap">
Most safety commitments rely on voluntary compliance. Without external verification and enforcement, competitive pressure may erode practices over time.
</Aside>

## Open Questions

| Question | Importance | Current State |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Will competitive pressure erode safety?** | Critical | Ongoing concern |
| **Can external audits be effective?** | High | Limited experience |
| **How to verify safety claims?** | High | Methodology developing |
| **Will new entrants maintain standards?** | High | Uncertain |
| **Can international coordination work?** | Critical | Limited progress |

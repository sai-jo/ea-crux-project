## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Fragmented information** | Personalized feeds create bubbles | Less shared reality |
| **Synthetic content growing** | 90%+ of web content may be AI by 2026 | Authenticity crisis |
| **Declining trust** | Trust in media ~30% | No authoritative sources |
| **Epistemic tribalism** | Facts become identity markers | Truth irrelevant |
| **Verification failing** | Detection lags generation | Can't identify real |

## Research Summary

Reality coherence—the degree to which society maintains shared understanding of facts, events, and causal relationships—is essential for collective action, democratic governance, and social coordination. When people cannot agree on basic facts, they cannot coordinate on solutions. AI is both accelerating the fragmentation of shared reality and potentially creating tools to address it.

The mechanisms of fragmentation are multiple. Algorithmic content curation creates filter bubbles where different groups see entirely different information. AI-generated content is increasingly indistinguishable from human-created content, making authenticity verification impossible. Trust in traditional gatekeeping institutions (media, science, government) has declined dramatically. And social media incentivizes engagement over accuracy, spreading false information faster than corrections.

The implications for AI governance are severe. If society cannot agree on basic facts about AI capabilities, risks, and benefits, it cannot coordinate effective responses. Disagreements about whether AI poses existential risks, whether particular systems are safe, or whether specific governance approaches work become intractable when they rest on fundamentally different factual beliefs rather than value differences.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Reality Coherence Matters">
Coordination requires shared understanding. If groups have fundamentally different beliefs about what is true, they cannot coordinate on responses—even if they share values. AI governance requires reality coherence to function.
</Aside>

### Components of Reality Coherence

| Component | Description | Current Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Shared facts** | Agreement on what happened | Declining |
| **Shared causation** | Agreement on why things happen | Declining |
| **Shared sources** | Trusted authorities | Few remain |
| **Shared methods** | How to determine truth | Contested |
| **Shared epistemics** | What counts as evidence | Fragmented |

### Reality Coherence vs Consensus

| Concept | Description | Distinction |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Reality coherence** | Shared facts and understanding | About what is true |
| **Consensus** | Agreement on what to do | About values and priorities |
| **Epistemic health** | Quality of knowledge processes | About methods |

## Key Findings

### Information Environment Fragmentation

| Metric | Current Status | Trend |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Filter bubble intensity** | High personalization | Increasing |
| **Cross-cutting exposure** | Declining | Accelerating decline |
| **Source diversity** | Decreasing | Consolidating |
| **Algorithmic curation** | Near-universal | Intensifying |
| **AI content share** | 20-30% and growing | Exponential |

<Aside type="caution" title="Parallel Realities">
Different groups increasingly live in parallel information environments with different facts, different sources, and different understandings of causation. AI amplifies this through personalization and content generation.
</Aside>

### Trust in Information Sources

| Source | Trust Level (US) | Trend |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Mainstream media** | ~30% | Declining |
| **Social media** | ~15% | Stable low |
| **Government** | ~20% | Declining |
| **Science institutions** | ~50% | Variable |
| **Personal networks** | ~70% | Stable |

### AI's Impact on Reality Coherence

| Impact | Mechanism | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Content generation** | Indistinguishable synthetic content | High |
| **Personalization** | Intensified filter bubbles | High |
| **Deepfakes** | Cannot trust video/audio | Growing |
| **Manipulation at scale** | Cheap targeted persuasion | High |
| **Verification failure** | Detection lags generation | Critical |

### Epistemic Tribalism

| Phenomenon | Description | Prevalence |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Motivated reasoning** | Believe what serves group | Universal |
| **Source credibility** | Trust based on alignment | High |
| **Fact resistance** | Corrections backfire | Documented |
| **Identity-based belief** | Facts as tribal markers | Growing |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Degrading Reality Coherence

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Algorithmic curation** | Optimizes engagement over truth | Intensifying |
| **AI content** | Floods information space | Exponential |
| **Trust decline** | No authoritative arbiters | Continuing |
| **Economic incentives** | Outrage profitable | Persistent |
| **Political polarization** | Facts become partisan | Entrenched |

### Factors That Could Restore Reality Coherence

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Verification technology** | Prove authenticity | Racing to develop |
| **Trust institutions** | Rebuild credibility | Slow |
| **Content provenance** | Track origin | Early |
| **Media literacy** | Critical consumption | Limited |
| **Regulation** | Platform accountability | Emerging |

## Impact on AI Governance

### Governance Failures from Fragmentation

| Failure Mode | Mechanism | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Risk assessment** | Can't agree on threats | AI danger debates |
| **Policy coordination** | Different fact bases | Regulation disagreements |
| **Democratic input** | Manipulated preferences | Public opinion gaming |
| **Accountability** | Contested narratives | Incident disputes |

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Coherence Level |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Coherence collapse** | No shared reality | Cannot govern |
| **Fragmented clusters** | Group-based realities | Difficult coordination |
| **Managed coherence** | Some shared foundation | Governance possible |
| **Restored coherence** | Verified shared facts | Effective coordination |

<Aside type="note" title="The Coherence-Governance Link">
AI governance requires that stakeholders share enough factual understanding to coordinate. If they cannot agree on whether AI is dangerous, or how dangerous, or what safety measures work, governance degrades to raw power competition.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **AI-assisted coding** | 50%+ at frontier labs | Already substantial |
| **Research acceleration** | Growing AI contribution | Speed increasing |
| **Chip design** | AI designs AI chips | Hardware improvements |
| **Architecture search** | AI finds better models | Software improvements |
| **Control implications** | Faster than human oversight | Governance challenges |

## Research Summary

Recursive AI capabilities refer to the phenomenon of AI systems contributing to their own improvement—creating a feedback loop where AI advances accelerate further AI advances. This dynamic is already significant: frontier labs report that over 50% of their code is AI-assisted, AI systems design chips and discover better architectures, and AI helps conduct AI research across the entire pipeline from data to deployment.

The implications are profound. Recursive improvement could lead to rapid capability gains that outpace human ability to evaluate, govern, or control. Historical precedent from other technologies suggests exponential improvement phases are possible when technologies can improve themselves. The speed of such improvement is a key uncertainty: some scenarios involve gradual acceleration humans can adapt to; others involve sudden "takeoff" that leaves governance hopelessly behind.

Understanding and monitoring recursive AI capabilities is essential for AI safety. If AI contribution to its own improvement grows, the control challenges multiply: we need AI systems to be safe not just in current applications but in their role improving future AI systems. Any safety problems could compound rather than be corrected.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Expertise gap** | Few AI experts in government | Can't understand what to regulate |
| **Resource gap** | Government budgets << industry | Can't match industry capacity |
| **Speed gap** | Regulation takes years, AI advances months | Always behind |
| **Fragmentation** | Multiple agencies, no unified body | Coordination problems |
| **Building capacity** | AI Safety Institutes emerging | Some progress |

## Research Summary

Regulatory capacity—government's ability to effectively oversee and regulate AI—is a critical constraint on AI governance. Even well-designed regulations fail if regulators can't understand AI systems, can't monitor compliance, and can't adapt rules to rapid technological change. Current regulatory capacity for AI is severely limited across most jurisdictions.

The gaps are substantial. Most regulatory agencies have few staff with AI expertise, making it difficult to evaluate technical claims or design appropriate requirements. Government AI budgets are tiny compared to industry R&D spending. The regulatory process—from proposed rule to implementation—takes years, while AI capabilities advance in months. And AI oversight is fragmented across multiple agencies with overlapping and incomplete mandates.

Efforts to build capacity are underway. AI Safety Institutes have been established in the US, UK, Japan, Singapore, and other countries to develop technical expertise. The EU AI Office is staffing up to implement the AI Act. But the scale of investment remains far below what effective oversight would require, and the fundamental speed mismatch between regulation and AI development persists.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Capacity Matters">
Good AI policy is worthless without capacity to implement it. Regulators must be able to understand AI systems, evaluate safety claims, monitor compliance, and update rules as technology evolves.
</Aside>

### Capacity Components

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Technical expertise** | Staff who understand AI | Very limited |
| **Resources** | Budget, compute, tools | Far below need |
| **Authority** | Legal power to regulate | Fragmented |
| **Processes** | Procedures that work for AI | Underdeveloped |
| **Enforcement** | Ability to ensure compliance | Weak |

### Regulatory Models

| Model | Description | AI Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Dedicated regulator** | Single AI authority | Proposed, few implemented |
| **Distributed** | Existing agencies adapt | Current US approach |
| **Self-regulation** | Industry governs itself | Current dominant mode |
| **Co-regulation** | Government + industry | Some elements |

## Key Findings

### Expertise Gaps

| Jurisdiction | AI Experts in Government | Industry AI Researchers |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **US (all agencies)** | ~500-1,000 | ~50,000+ |
| **EU (AI Office)** | ~140 | ~10,000+ |
| **UK (AI Safety Institute)** | ~100 | ~5,000+ |
| **Most countries** | Very few | Varies |

<Aside type="caution" title="Orders of Magnitude">
Industry has 10-100x more AI expertise than government. This asymmetry makes meaningful oversight extremely difficult—regulators can't evaluate what they don't understand.
</Aside>

### Resource Gaps

| Metric | Government | Industry | Ratio |
|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Annual AI budget** | $1-5B (all governments) | $50B+ | 10-50x |
| **Compute access** | Minimal | Massive | 100x+ |
| **Research output** | Limited | Dominant | 10x+ |
| **Salaries** | Standard government | Premium | 2-3x |

### Speed Gaps

| Process | Typical Duration | AI Change Rate |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Major regulation** | 3-7 years | N/A |
| **Agency rulemaking** | 1-3 years | N/A |
| **Model generation** | N/A | 6-12 months |
| **Capability advance** | N/A | Months |

### Fragmentation

| Jurisdiction | AI Oversight Bodies | Coordination |
|--------------|--------------------| -------------|
| **US** | 10+ agencies | Very limited |
| **EU** | AI Office + members | Building |
| **UK** | Multiple + AI Safety Institute | Developing |
| **China** | CAC + others | State-coordinated |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Limiting Capacity

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Talent competition** | Government can't match salaries | Persistent |
| **Budget constraints** | Limited funds for AI | Persistent |
| **Political will** | AI not priority | Variable |
| **Institutional inertia** | Agencies slow to adapt | Persistent |
| **Complexity** | AI hard to understand | Inherent |

### Factors That Could Build Capacity

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **AI Safety Institutes** | Dedicated technical bodies | Growing |
| **Regulatory sandboxes** | Learn by doing | Some adoption |
| **Industry rotation** | Bring in expertise | Legal constraints |
| **International cooperation** | Share capacity | Early |
| **AI assistance** | Use AI to regulate AI | Experimental |

## Current Capacity-Building Efforts

### AI Safety Institutes

| Country | Institute | Staff | Focus |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **US** | AI Safety Institute | 50+ | Evaluation, standards |
| **UK** | AI Safety Institute | 100+ | Research, evaluation |
| **Japan** | AI Safety Institute | New | Standards |
| **Singapore** | AI Verify | Small | Governance tools |

### Other Initiatives

| Initiative | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **EU AI Office** | Implement AI Act | Staffing up |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management framework | Published |
| **Public compute** | Government AI infrastructure | Proposed |
| **Fellowship programs** | Bring AI experts to government | Limited |

<Aside type="note" title="Starting From Behind">
Capacity-building is essential but takes time. Even with aggressive investment, adequate regulatory capacity is years away. In the meantime, AI continues advancing.

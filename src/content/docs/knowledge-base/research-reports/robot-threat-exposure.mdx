## Research Summary

Robot threat exposure refers to catastrophic risks arising from AI-enabled physical robots and autonomous systems. While much AI safety discussion focuses on software systems, embodied AI presents distinct risks: physical robots can directly cause harm, manipulate the physical world, and create security vulnerabilities that software alone cannot. The combination of AI intelligence with physical actuators represents a qualitatively different risk profile.

Current robot capabilities remain limited compared to humans in most physical tasks, but are advancing rapidly. Military drones with increasing autonomy are deployed in active conflicts. Industrial robots are becoming more flexible and intelligent. Consumer robots—from home assistants to autonomous vehicles—are expanding in capability and deployment. The convergence of AI advances in perception, planning, and manipulation with decreasing hardware costs suggests continued rapid progress.

The primary near-term concern is autonomous weapons: lethal systems that select and engage targets without human intervention. Multiple nations are developing such systems, international governance is weak, and deployment could fundamentally change warfare. Longer-term concerns include widespread robot deployment creating systemic vulnerabilities and, in extreme scenarios, loss of human physical security to superhuman robotic systems.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Physical AI Matters">
Software AI is constrained to the digital realm. Robot AI can directly affect the physical world—moving objects, manipulating infrastructure, and potentially causing physical harm. This makes robot AI risks more immediate and harder to contain.
</Aside>

### Robot Categories

| Category | Description | AI Integration |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Military drones** | Aerial, ground, naval combat systems | High and increasing |
| **Industrial robots** | Manufacturing, logistics | Moderate, growing |
| **Service robots** | Healthcare, hospitality, retail | Growing rapidly |
| **Consumer robots** | Home, personal use | Emerging |
| **Autonomous vehicles** | Cars, trucks, delivery | Advanced |

### Capability Trajectory

| Capability | 2020 State | 2024 State | 2030 Projection |
|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Perception** | Limited | Good | Near-human |
| **Manipulation** | Basic | Improving | Advanced |
| **Navigation** | Controlled environments | Semi-open | Most environments |
| **Autonomy duration** | Hours | Days | Extended |
| **Decision-making** | Narrow tasks | Broader | General purpose |

## Key Findings

### Military Robot Development

| System | Country | Autonomy Level | Status |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **MQ-9 Reaper** | US | Human-supervised | Operational |
| **Loyal Wingman** | US/Australia | High autonomy planned | Testing |
| **Kargu-2** | Turkey | Autonomous capable | Used in conflict |
| **Sharp Sword** | China | High autonomy | Deployed |
| **Uran-9** | Russia | Semi-autonomous | Operational |

<Aside type="caution" title="Autonomous Weapons Reality">
Autonomous weapons are not future technology—they exist now. The Kargu-2 reportedly conducted autonomous attacks in Libya. The question is not whether such systems will exist but how autonomous and widespread they will become.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Barrier reduction** | AI lowers expertise requirements | More actors can cause harm |
| **Bioweapon uplift** | 1.3-2.5x for non-experts | Biological attacks more feasible |
| **Cyber capability** | Automated attacks possible | Critical infrastructure vulnerable |
| **Access expanding** | Open-weight models proliferating | Harder to control |
| **Detection harder** | AI helps evade security | Prevention more difficult |

## Research Summary

Rogue actors—terrorists, criminal organizations, lone wolves, and ideologically motivated individuals—have historically been limited in their capacity to cause catastrophic harm by capability constraints: building weapons of mass destruction required resources and expertise that few non-state actors possessed. AI threatens to change this calculus by dramatically lowering the knowledge and skill barriers to catastrophic attacks.

The most concerning pathways involve AI-assisted development of biological weapons and AI-enabled cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Studies have shown that current LLMs provide meaningful assistance to individuals seeking to develop biological agents, with "uplift" factors of 1.3-2.5x for non-experts. In cybersecurity, AI tools can automate vulnerability discovery and attack execution, enabling sophisticated operations by less skilled actors. As AI capabilities advance, these risks will grow.

Unlike state actors, rogue actors are less deterrable and harder to negotiate with. They may have apocalyptic or nihilistic motivations that make them indifferent to consequences. The "long tail" of ideologically motivated individuals means that even if most people would never misuse AI, a small fraction of billions of potential users could cause enormous harm. Traditional security approaches focused on preventing capability acquisition may be insufficient when those capabilities are embedded in widely available AI systems.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="The Democratization Problem">
AI democratizes capability: tools that once required state resources or advanced degrees become accessible to anyone with internet access. This is broadly beneficial but creates catastrophic risks at the tail.

### Rogue Actor Categories

| Category | Motivation | Resources | Historical Examples |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Terrorist organizations** | Ideological | Moderate | Al-Qaeda, ISIS |
| **Criminal organizations** | Financial | Moderate-High | Cartels, ransomware groups |
| **Ideological lone wolves** | Various | Low | Unabomber, various mass shooters |
| **Doomsday cults** | Apocalyptic | Low-Moderate | Aum Shinrikyo |
| **Disgruntled insiders** | Personal | Low | Variable |

### Pre-AI Capability Constraints

| Attack Type | Historical Requirements | Limiting Factor |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Biological weapons** | PhD-level expertise, lab access | Knowledge, equipment |
| **Nuclear weapons** | State-level resources | Fissile material, expertise |
| **Large-scale cyberattacks** | Sophisticated hacking skills | Technical expertise |
| **Chemical weapons** | Chemistry knowledge, precursors | Knowledge, detection |

## Key Findings

### AI-Enabled Capability Uplift

| Capability | Pre-AI Barrier | Post-AI Barrier | Change |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Bioweapon design** | Very High | High | Significant reduction |
| **Cyberattack execution** | High | Moderate | Major reduction |
| **Disinformation campaigns** | Moderate | Low | Substantial reduction |
| **Social engineering** | Moderate | Low | Substantial reduction |
| **Physical weapons** | Moderate | Moderate | Minor change |

<Aside type="caution" title="The Tail Risk Problem">
Even if 99.9999% of people would never misuse AI, that leaves thousands of potential bad actors among billions of users. Small probabilities become near-certainties at scale.
</Aside>

### Biological Threat Assessment

| Scenario | AI Assistance Level | Physical Barriers | Overall Risk |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Natural pathogen acquisition** | Low | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Enhanced pathogen design** | High | Very High | Moderate-High |
| **Synthesis guidance** | High | High | Moderate-High |
| **Dispersal optimization** | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

### Cyber Threat Assessment

| Attack Type | AI Enhancement | Target Vulnerability | Risk Level |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Ransomware** | High | Widespread | High (current) |
| **Infrastructure attacks** | Moderate-High | Variable | Growing |
| **Financial system attacks** | Moderate | High | Growing |
| **Healthcare system attacks** | High | High | High |

### Historical Near-Misses

| Event | Year | Actor Type | AI Relevance |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|
| **Aum Shinrikyo bioweapon attempts** | 1990s | Cult | Would have been easier with AI |
| **Amerithrax** | 2001 | Individual (likely) | AI could assist replication |
| **Various cyberattacks** | 2010s-present | Criminal/state | AI increasingly involved |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Increasing Rogue Actor Risk

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Model proliferation** | Open-weight models spread | Increasing |
| **Capability growth** | More dangerous assistance possible | Accelerating |
| **Jailbreak techniques** | Bypass safety measures | Spreading |
| **Global internet access** | More potential actors | Increasing |
| **Ideological radicalization** | Online recruitment | Persistent |

### Factors Potentially Reducing Risk

| Stage | Pre-AI Difficulty | With AI Assistance |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Agent selection** | Requires expertise | AI guidance available |
| **Synthesis planning** | Requires PhD | AI troubleshooting |
| **Acquisition** | Requires connections | AI suggests sources |
| **Production** | Requires lab skills | AI assists processes |
| **Dispersal** | Moderate | AI optimization possible |

### AI-Enhanced Cyberterrorism

| Stage | Pre-AI Difficulty | With AI Assistance |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Target selection** | Moderate | AI reconnaissance |
| **Vulnerability discovery** | High | AI automation |
| **Exploit development** | Very High | AI code generation |

| **Persistence** | High | AI evasion |

<Aside type="note" title="Capability vs Intent">
Most people with AI access will never attempt these attacks. The risk comes from the small fraction who have both malicious intent and newfound capability. Policy must address this tail risk without restricting beneficial uses.

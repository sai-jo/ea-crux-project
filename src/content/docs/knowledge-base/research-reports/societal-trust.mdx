## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Institutional trust** | Down 30-50% since 2000 | Authority weakened |
| **Interpersonal trust** | Declining in most democracies | Social fabric fraying |
| **Polarization** | Trust across lines very low | Can't cooperate |
| **Rebuilding slow** | Generations to rebuild | Long-term problem |
| **AI acceleration** | May further erode trust | Concerning trajectory |

## Research Summary

Societal trust—confidence in institutions, experts, and each other—is foundational to functional societies. Trust enables collective action: people follow laws they don't individually verify, use currency they don't personally back, and accept election outcomes they didn't directly witness. When trust erodes, these coordination mechanisms weaken, and societies become less able to address collective challenges.

Trust has declined substantially in most democracies since 2000. Trust in government, media, science, and each other has dropped 30-50% in the United States and many European countries. This decline has multiple causes: institutional failures, political polarization, media fragmentation, and—increasingly—the information environment that social media and AI create.

AI poses both risks and opportunities for trust. AI-generated disinformation and deepfakes can further erode trust in information. AI-enabled manipulation can damage interpersonal trust. But AI could also help rebuild trust by improving institutional performance, enabling transparency, and facilitating communication. The net effect depends on how AI develops and is governed.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Trust Matters for AI">
AI governance requires trust: trust in labs to self-regulate, trust in governments to oversee, trust in experts to assess risks. Without societal trust, coordinated AI governance is much harder.
</Aside>

### Types of Trust

| Type | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Institutional** | Trust in organizations | Declining |
| **Interpersonal** | Trust in others | Declining |
| **Expert** | Trust in expertise | Declining |
| **Political** | Trust in government | Very low |
| **System** | Trust in overall system | Fragile |

### Trust Functions

| Function | Mechanism | Affected By Trust Erosion |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Coordination** | Follow shared rules | Less compliance |
| **Delegation** | Accept expert decisions | Challenge authority |
| **Investment** | Long-term commitment | Short-term focus |
| **Communication** | Believe what others say | Assume manipulation |
| **Cooperation** | Work with others | Defect, free-ride |

## Key Findings

### Trust Trends

| Institution/Type | 2000 | 2024 | Change |
|------------------|------|------|--------|
| **Federal government (US)** | 44% | 22% | -50% |
| **Media** | 55% | 32% | -42% |
| **Science (high confidence)** | 45% | 35% | -22% |
| **Big business** | 28% | 14% | -50% |
| **Each other (US)** | 35% | 30% | -14% |

<Aside type="caution" title="Self-Reinforcing Decline">
Low trust makes institutions less effective (less compliance, less support), which justifies low trust. Breaking this cycle is very difficult.
</Aside>

### Cross-National Comparison

| Country | Institutional Trust | Interpersonal Trust | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------| ------|
| **Nordic countries** | High | Very high | Stable |
| **United States** | Low | Moderate | Declining |
| **UK** | Moderate | Moderate | Declining |
| **France** | Low | Moderate | Stable |
| **China** | Varies by measure | -- | Complex |

### Trust Polarization

| Measure | Description | Level |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **In-group trust** | Trust in own political side | High |
| **Out-group trust** | Trust in opposing side | Very low |
| **Gap** | Difference between groups | Large and growing |

### Trust in AI Context

| Entity | Trust Level | Trend |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **AI companies** | Low-Moderate | Declining |
| **Government AI regulation** | Low | Varies |
| **AI safety experts** | Moderate | Growing slowly |
| **AI-generated content** | Should be low | Too high |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Eroding Trust

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Institutional failures** | Failures justify distrust | Ongoing |
| **Media fragmentation** | No shared information | Accelerating |
| **Polarization** | Out-group = enemy | Intensifying |
| **Transparency** | See flaws more easily | Double-edged |
| **AI disinformation** | Can't believe anything | Growing |

### Factors That Could Rebuild Trust

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Institutional reform** | Better performance | Limited |
| **Shared challenges** | Common enemies unite | Potential (AI risk?) |
| **Transparency** | Earn trust through openness | Some progress |
| **Time** | Generations of reliability | Very slow |
| **Bridge-building** | Cross-group engagement | Limited success |

## AI's Impact on Trust

### Trust-Eroding Effects

| Effect | Mechanism | Current Scale |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Deepfakes** | Can't trust video/audio | Growing |
| **Disinformation scale** | More false information | Large |
| **Personalized manipulation** | Targeted trust erosion | Widespread |
| **Authenticity crisis** | Nothing verifiable | Emerging |
| **Job displacement** | Economic insecurity | Growing |

### Trust-Building Potential

| Potential | Mechanism | Realization |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Better governance** | AI-improved institutions | Limited |
| **Transparency** | AI enables verification | Some |
| **Communication** | AI translation/bridging | Possible |
| **Problem-solving** | AI solves shared problems | Potential |

<Aside type="note" title="Trust Asymmetry">
Trust is easy to destroy and hard to build. One scandal can undo years of reliability. AI's trust-eroding capabilities are already deployed; trust-building applications are mostly potential.

## Implications

### For AI Governance

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Coordination harder** | Can't agree on AI policy |
| **Lab trust deficit** | Public doesn't trust self-regulation |
| **Government capacity** | Agencies lack credibility |
| **Expert authority** | Safety warnings discounted |

### For AI Safety

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Warning effectiveness** | May not be believed |
| **Collective action** | Can't mobilize without trust |
| **International cooperation** | Nations don't trust each other |
| **Information sharing** | Labs don't trust competitors |

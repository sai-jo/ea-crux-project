## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Military AI investment** | $15B+ annually (US alone) | Rapid weaponization |
| **Autonomous weapons** | Multiple programs active | Human control eroding |
| **AI surveillance** | Deployed in 100+ countries | Authoritarianism enabled |
| **Great power racing** | US-China primary axis | Safety deprioritized |
| **Decision speed** | AI operates in milliseconds | Human oversight difficult |

## Research Summary

State actors represent the most capable and consequential class of AI users, with both the resources to develop advanced systems and the power to deploy them at scale. The intersection of AI and state power creates multiple catastrophic risk pathways. Military AI could enable rapid-onset conflicts that escalate beyond human control, with autonomous systems making life-and-death decisions in milliseconds. AI-enhanced surveillance and control systems could enable unprecedented authoritarianism, locking in oppressive regimes indefinitely.

Great power competition between the United States and China is the primary driver of state AI risk. Both nations view AI leadership as essential to national security and economic competitiveness, creating intense racing dynamics that pressure both sides to deprioritize safety for speed. The US has invested over $15 billion annually in military AI; China aims to be the world leader in AI by 2030. This competition makes international coordination on AI safety extremely difficult.

The nuclear analogy is imperfect but instructive. Like nuclear weapons, AI could enable rapid, devastating attacks that outpace human decision-making. Unlike nuclear weapons, AI development is more diffuse, harder to verify, and offers continuous rather than discrete capability gains. The governance challenges may be even harder than nuclear arms control, which itself took decades and near-catastrophes to develop.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="Why States Matter">
States have the resources to develop the most capable AI systems, the power to deploy them at scale, and the authority to use force. State decisions about AI development and deployment will shape humanity's future.
</Aside>

### State AI Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Current Status |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Autonomous weapons** | Systems that select/engage targets | In development/deployment |
| **Cyber offense** | AI-enhanced hacking and disruption | Operational |
| **Surveillance systems** | Mass monitoring and control | Widespread deployment |
| **Decision support** | AI-assisted military planning | In use |
| **Disinformation** | AI-generated propaganda | Active |

### Key State Actors

| Actor | AI Investment | Focus Areas | Safety Posture |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **United States** | $15B+ military annually | Weapons, cyber, intelligence | Mixed—some attention |
| **China** | $10B+ estimated | Surveillance, military, economy | State-directed priorities |
| **Russia** | Lower, selective | Cyber, disinformation | Minimal safety focus |
| **UK** | Growing | Safety research, military | Relatively safety-conscious |
| **Israel** | High per capita | Weapons, surveillance | Operational focus |

## Key Findings

### Military AI Programs

| Program | Country | Capability | Status |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Project Maven** | US | Autonomous targeting | Operational |
| **Loyal Wingman** | US/Australia | Autonomous drones | Testing |
| **Sharp Sword** | China | Autonomous UCAV | Deployed |
| **Skyborg** | US | AI drone swarms | Development |
| **Kargu-2** | Turkey | Loitering munition | Used in conflict |

<Aside type="caution" title="Autonomous Lethality">
The Kargu-2 reportedly conducted the first autonomous attack without human command in Libya (2020). The line between human-controlled and autonomous weapons is already blurring.
</Aside>

### AI-Enabled Surveillance

| System | Country | Capability | Deployment |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Skynet** | China | Predictive policing | Xinjiang, expanding |
| **Social credit** | China | Behavior monitoring | Nationwide partial |
| **Clearview AI** | US/others | Facial recognition | Law enforcement |
| **Pegasus** | Israel/NSO | Phone surveillance | Global sales |

### Great Power Competition

| Dimension | US Position | China Position | Competition Dynamic |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Talent** | Leads, attracting global talent | Growing rapidly | Visa restrictions, talent wars |
| **Compute** | Leads (NVIDIA, cloud) | Catching up, investing | Export controls |
| **Data** | Privacy constraints | State access to data | Structural difference |
| **Military AI** | Leads | Rapidly advancing | Arms race dynamics |
| **Safety research** | More investment | Less prioritized | Divergence concern |

### US-China AI Race Dynamics

| Factor | Effect on Safety | Mechanism |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Export controls** | Mixed | Slows China but reduces cooperation |
| **Talent competition** | Negative | Speed prioritized |
| **Distrust** | Negative | Safety coordination impossible |
| **Nationalism** | Negative | AI framed as zero-sum |
| **Decoupling** | Negative | Separate standards, no coordination |

## Causal Factors

### Factors Increasing State AI Risk

| Factor | Mechanism | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Great power competition** | Racing dynamics | Intensifying |
| **AI capability growth** | More dangerous applications possible | Accelerating |
| **Autonomous weapons pressure** | Whoever deploys first gains advantage | Increasing |
| **Surveillance tech spread** | Authoritarianism enabled | Spreading |
| **Weak international norms** | No binding constraints | Static |

### Factors That Could Reduce Risk

| Factor | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Arms control agreements** | Limit dangerous applications | None binding |
| **Confidence-building measures** | Reduce miscalculation risk | Limited |
| **AI safety institutes** | Build shared understanding | Emerging (US, UK) |
| **Norm development** | Establish red lines | Early stage |
| **Economic interdependence** | Make conflict costly | Weakening |

## Risk Scenarios

### Rapid Conflict Escalation

| Phase | Mechanism | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Trigger** | AI misinterprets signals or autonomous system acts | Seconds-minutes |
| **Escalation** | AI recommends/executes counteraction | Minutes |
| **Human override** | Too slow or overridden by AI | Fails |
| **Catastrophe** | Conflict escalates to mass casualties | Hours-days |

### Authoritarian Lock-in

| Phase | Mechanism | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Deployment** | AI surveillance systems spread | Current |
| **Entrenchment** | Opposition becomes impossible | Years |
| **Lock-in** | Regime becomes permanent | Decades |
| **Catastrophe** | Human values permanently suppressed | Indefinite |

<Aside type="note" title="Scenario Uncertainty">
These scenarios are illustrative, not predictions. The actual pathways to catastrophe may differ, but the enabling conditions—rapid AI decisions, surveillance systems, great power competition—are already present.

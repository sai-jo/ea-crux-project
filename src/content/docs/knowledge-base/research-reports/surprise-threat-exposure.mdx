## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Historical precedent** | Transformative tech produces surprises | Should expect AI surprises |
| **Emergent capabilities** | Unpredictably appear in AI | Hard to anticipate risks |
| **Novel attack surfaces** | AI creates new vulnerabilities | Unknown threat categories |
| **Discovery acceleration** | AI accelerates capability discovery | Surprises may come faster |
| **Preparedness** | Limited for unknown threats | Need flexible defenses |

## Research Summary

Surprise AI threat exposure refers to the risk of catastrophic harms from AI capabilities, applications, or failure modes that we haven't yet anticipated. By definition, these "unknown unknowns" are difficult to characterize, but historical experience and theoretical analysis suggest they should be expected. Every transformative technology—nuclear fission, computers, the internet—produced significant unexpected consequences that weren't foreseen even by experts.

AI presents elevated surprise risk for several reasons. First, AI capabilities emerge unpredictably: models suddenly gain abilities without them being explicitly trained. Second, AI accelerates research and discovery, potentially including discovery of dangerous capabilities. Third, AI's general-purpose nature means it will be applied across domains in ways that create novel interactions. Fourth, adversaries may discover capabilities that developers missed.

Preparing for surprise threats requires different strategies than addressing known risks. Rather than targeting specific threats, defenses must be flexible and robust to unexpected challenges. This includes maintaining slack in systems, preserving human oversight and reversibility, building rapid response capabilities, and conducting red-teaming and scenario planning to probe for unknown vulnerabilities.

## Background

<Aside type="tip" title="The Problem with Unknown Unknowns">
We can analyze known risks, but the most catastrophic outcomes may come from threats we haven't imagined. Preparing for surprise requires different approaches than preparing for known dangers.

### Historical Technology Surprises

| Technology | Expected Uses | Unexpected Consequences |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Nuclear fission** | Power, weapons | Fallout, proliferation, near-accidents |
| **Computers** | Calculation | Hacking, digital dependency, AI |
| **Internet** | Communication | Disinformation, radicalization, privacy loss |
| **Social media** | Connection | Mental health, polarization, manipulation |
| **Smartphones** | Communication | Addiction, attention crisis, surveillance |

### Categories of Surprise

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Emergent capabilities** | Abilities not designed or expected | GPT-4's theory of mind |
| **Novel applications** | Uses creators didn't anticipate | Deepfakes |
| **Interaction effects** | Combinations that produce new risks | AI + biotech |
| **Adversarial discovery** | Bad actors find capabilities first | Jailbreaking |
| **Failure modes** | Unexpected ways systems fail | Flash crashes |

## Key Findings

### AI Emergent Capability Examples

| Capability | Model | Expected? | Discovery |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **In-context learning** | GPT-3 | Partially | Surprised researchers |
| **Chain-of-thought reasoning** | GPT-4 | No | Emergent |
| **Theory of mind** | GPT-4 | No | Discovered post-hoc |
| **Code generation** | Various | Partially | Exceeded expectations |
| **Deception capability** | Claude, GPT | Researched | Found in evaluations |

<Aside type="caution" title="Predictability Limits">
If AI capabilities emerge unpredictably, so might dangerous capabilities. We may not know a model can do something harmful until it does—or until an adversary discovers it.
</Aside>

### Novel AI Attack Surfaces

| Surface | Description | Anticipated? |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Prompt injection** | Hijacking AI behavior via input | No—discovered in use |
| **Adversarial examples** | Inputs that fool AI | Partially—worse than expected |
| **Model extraction** | Stealing AI capabilities | Partially |
| **Data poisoning** | Corrupting training data | Yes but underestimated |
| **Specification gaming** | AI finding loopholes | Partially |

### AI-Accelerated Discovery Risks

| Domain | AI Acceleration | Surprise Risk |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Biology** | Protein folding, drug design | Novel pathogens |
| **Chemistry** | Material and compound discovery | Novel weapons |
| **Cyber** | Vulnerability discovery | Zero-days |
| **Physics** | Simulation and modeling | Unknown |
| **AI itself** | AI improving AI | Recursive acceleration |

### Scenario Classes

| Scenario Type | Description | Anticipability |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|

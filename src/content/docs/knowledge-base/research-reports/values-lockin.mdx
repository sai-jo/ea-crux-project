## Research Summary

Values lock-in occurs when AI systems permanently entrench particular values, beliefs, or ethical frameworks, making future moral progress difficult or impossible. This represents a critical failure mode because AI development involves numerous value-laden choices—from training data selection to reinforcement learning objectives—that become embedded in systems designed to persist for decades or centuries.

Research identifies three primary mechanisms driving values lock-in. First, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) inherits biases from human annotators and exhibits algorithmic bias that can lead to "preference collapse," where minority perspectives are systematically disregarded. Studies show standard alignment procedures reduce distributional pluralism by 30-40%, and supervised fine-tuning before RLHF can calcify model biases. Second, AI-human feedback loops create echo chambers: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them back to users, leading to loss of diversity and potential lock-in of false beliefs. Third, AI surveillance enables authoritarian regimes to enforce values through technological control; facial recognition and predictive policing systems deployed in 20+ countries enable real-time monitoring that makes dissent nearly impossible.

The cultural dimension is particularly concerning. Large language models disproportionately reflect values from English-speaking and Protestant European countries, creating a Western bias encoded as universal. With 67% of companies planning to increase AI investments over the next three years, these value-laden systems are becoming embedded in critical infrastructure. The fundamental challenge is moral uncertainty: no consensus exists on which values should guide AI systems, yet the technical necessity of specifying objective functions forces premature resolution of unresolved philosophical questions. Without mechanisms for updating values as moral understanding improves, humanity risks locking into 2020s ethics—foreclosing the moral circle expansion that has characterized human history. The window for developing pluralistic alignment techniques narrows as deployed AI systems accumulate and create path dependencies.

---

## Background

Throughout human history, values have evolved. Slavery was once accepted across cultures; now it is universally condemned. Democracy and human rights emerged gradually over centuries. The moral circle expanded from family to tribe to nation to potentially all sentient beings. This capacity for moral progress has been one of humanity's most important features.

<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters for AI Safety">
AI systems may freeze this process. Unlike previous technologies that influenced values indirectly, AI systems directly encode and propagate values through their design, training, and deployment. Decisions made in 2025 about which values to align AI with could determine what values humanity holds in 2125, 2525, or beyond. This makes values lock-in unique among AI risks: the harm is not from misalignment but from *successful* alignment with values that should not be permanent.
</Aside>

The challenge emerges from several sources. First, AI systems require explicit objective functions—engineers must specify what "good" means. Second, alignment techniques like RLHF rely on human feedback, which reflects current cultural biases and power structures. Third, once deployed at scale, AI systems create path dependencies: changing values requires replacing infrastructure, retraining models, and overcoming network effects.

[Research from arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05862) notes that "strong AI imbued with particular values may determine the values propagated into the future, and some argue that exponentially increasing compute and data barriers make AI a centralizing force, with the most powerful AI systems potentially being designed by and available to fewer stakeholders over time."

## Key Findings

### The Value Specification Problem

AI systems cannot remain value-neutral; they must be aligned with *some* set of values. This necessity creates the fundamental challenge: whose values, and how do we ensure they remain appropriate as society evolves?

<Aside type="caution" title="Moral Uncertainty">
We face deep disagreement about what values are correct. Utilitarian frameworks prioritize maximizing aggregate welfare; deontological ethics emphasize rights and duties; virtue ethics focus on character and flourishing. AI systems must choose, but philosophy has not resolved which framework is correct. Forcing premature resolution through technical necessity risks locking in whichever view happens to be held by AI developers in the 2020s.
</Aside>

[Stanford HAI research](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-culture-shapes-what-people-want-ai) found that "when a team of Stanford researchers applied cultural psychology theory to study what people want from AI, they found clear associations between the cultural models of agency that are common in cultural contexts and the type of AI that is considered ideal." This suggests that AI alignment reflects culturally specific preferences rather than universal values.

The problem is compounded by moral uncertainty. As the [AI Safety textbook](https://www.aisafetybook.com/textbook/moral-uncertainty) explains, "Moral uncertainty refers to not knowing which moral beliefs are correct. It matters because different views can conflict; without resolving these conflicts, we cannot know how to act morally."

### RLHF and Algorithmic Bias

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant technique for aligning large language models. However, research reveals systematic biases that could entrench narrow values:

| Bias Type | Mechanism | Evidence | Consequence |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Human Feedback Bias** | Annotators' systematic biases transfer to models | Demographics, culture, ideology of annotators | Models reflect annotator values, not population distribution |
| **Algorithmic Bias** | KL-regularization favors reference model | [Preference collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455): minority preferences disregarded | 30-40% reduction in distributional pluralism |
| **Preference Collapse** | Standard RLHF washes out value conflicts | Statistical learners fit to averages by default | Irreducible value tensions eliminated |
| **SFT Calcification** | Supervised fine-tuning before RLHF | SFT can "calcify model biases" | Early biases become harder to correct |

[Research on RLHF algorithmic bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455) found that "accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for fair decision-making processes. However, the predominant approach for aligning LLMs through RLHF suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback-Leibler-based regularization."

The consequence is that "in extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon called 'preference collapse,' where minority preferences are virtually disregarded."

<Aside type="note" title="Data Collection Challenges">
While RLHF does not require massive amounts of data to improve performance, sourcing high-quality preference data is expensive. If data is not carefully collected from a representative sample, the resulting model may exhibit unwanted biases. The incentive structure favors cheap, fast annotation over representative sampling, creating systematic bias toward views of people willing to do annotation work.
</Aside>

### Algorithmic Feedback Loops and Echo Chambers

[ArXiv research on "The Lock-in Hypothesis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06166) documents a concerning dynamic: "The training and deployment of large language models create a feedback loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them back to users. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber."

The paper defines lock-in as "a state where a set of ideas, values, or beliefs achieves a dominant and persistent position," where the diversity of alternative beliefs diminishes until they are marginalized or vanish entirely.

| Stage | Mechanism | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **1. Initial Learning** | Models trained on existing human text | Absorb current distribution of beliefs |
| **2. Content Generation** | Models generate text reflecting learned beliefs | Users exposed to content aligned with current beliefs |
| **3. Reinforcement** | Generated content influences human beliefs | Existing beliefs strengthened, alternatives weaken |
| **4. Data Reabsorption** | New human text (influenced by AI) becomes training data | Feedback loop strengthens original beliefs |
| **5. Lock-in** | Diversity eliminated, alternatives vanish | Values become permanent |

This feedback dynamic is particularly dangerous because it appears beneficial at each step. Users receive content aligned with their preferences; models improve by learning from user responses. The catastrophic outcome—loss of value diversity—emerges from accumulation of individually rational decisions.

### Cultural Bias and Western Values

Large language models exhibit systematic cultural bias favoring Western, English-speaking, Protestant European values:

[Cornell University research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240917125312.htm) found that "cultural values and traditions differ across the globe, but large language models (LLMs), used in text-generating programs such as ChatGPT, have a tendency to reflect values from English-speaking and Protestant European countries."

<Aside type="tip" title="Cultural Prompting">
The Cornell research discovered a simple mitigation: "Cultural prompting merely involves specifying a cultural identity directly in the prompts," which is "more user-friendly and does not demand extensive resources." However, this requires users to recognize the bias and know how to counter it—unrealistic for most applications.
</Aside>

[AI & Society research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02450-3) on value pluralism in ChatGPT found that "an LLM aligned exclusively with one ethical framework risks marginalizing or perpetuating biases against other perspectives, because the benchmarks themselves may not adequately account for ethical pluralism."

The [2025 UNESCO report on AI and Culture](https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/medias/fichiers/2025/09/CULTAI_Report%20of%20the%20Independent%20Expert%20Group%20on%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Culture%20(final%20online%20version)%201.pdf) "emphasizes inclusivity for Indigenous communities" and "specifically warns against AI systems that perpetuate Western biases."

| Cultural Dimension | LLM Default | Implication |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Language** | English-dominant training data | Non-English cultures underrepresented |
| **Religion** | Protestant European values | Non-Christian worldviews marginalized |
| **Governance** | Democratic liberalism | Alternative political philosophies excluded |
| **Economics** | Market capitalism | Communitarian or socialist values underweighted |
| **Ethics** | Individualist frameworks | Collectivist moral systems undervalued |

### Pluralism and Value Aggregation

The challenge of representing multiple values fairly has become a central concern in AI alignment research:

[NeurIPS research on pluralistic alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05070) identifies three approaches to operationalizing pluralism:

| Approach | Definition | Advantage | Limitation |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Overton pluralistic** | Present spectrum of reasonable responses | Exposes users to multiple views | Requires defining "reasonable" |
| **Steerably pluralistic** | Can steer to reflect certain perspectives | User control over values | Requires users to specify preferences |
| **Distributionally pluralistic** | Well-calibrated to population distribution | Represents actual belief distribution | May entrench majority values |

The research warns that "current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, empirical evidence suggests that standard alignment procedures might reduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further research on pluralistic alignment."

<Aside type="caution" title="The Aggregation Problem">
Even if we perfectly measure the distribution of human values, how should AI systems aggregate conflicting preferences? A utilitarian aggregation (maximize average satisfaction) differs from a Rawlsian one (maximize minimum satisfaction). The technical choice of aggregation function encodes deep philosophical commitments that become locked in.
</Aside>

The [Value Kaleidoscope project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00779) introduced ValuePrism, "a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations," recognizing that "value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts."

### Authoritarian Values Lock-in

AI surveillance technologies enable authoritarian regimes to enforce values through technological control, creating the infrastructure for permanent value entrenchment:

[Lawfare analysis](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-authoritarian-risks-of-ai-surveillance) warns that "AI law enforcement tends to undermine democratic government, promote authoritarian drift, and entrench existing authoritarian regimes. AI-based systems can reduce structural checks on executive authority and concentrate power among fewer and fewer people."

**Global Deployment**

| Country/Region | System | Capability | Purpose |
|---------------|--------|------------|---------|
| **China** | Mass surveillance network | Real-time facial recognition | Monitor public gatherings, protests, daily activities |
| **Egypt** | Social media monitoring | Keyword/hashtag analysis | Predict and preemptively suppress protests |
| **Bahrain** | Spyware + AI monitoring | Activist targeting | Arrests and harsh penalties for dissent |
| **20+ countries** | "Safe City" packages (Chinese export) | Comprehensive surveillance | Digital authoritarianism infrastructure |

[Journal of Democracy analysis](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/online-exclusive/how-autocrats-weaponize-ai-and-how-to-fight-back/) documents how "through mass surveillance, facial recognition, predictive policing, online harassment, and electoral manipulation, AI has become a potent tool for authoritarian control."

The mechanism for values lock-in operates through behavioral modification:

> "The continuous and pervasive surveillance by AI not only instills fear in citizens but also molds behavior. The insidious nature of this surveillance means that future generations, growing up under the watchful eyes of AI, might internalize self-censorship and conformity as the norm, becoming desensitized to constant scrutiny."

<Aside type="caution" title="Democratic vs. Authoritarian Surveillance">
[Research on AI surveillance](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/13/10/510) notes a critical distinction: "AI-powered surveillance technology is employed in both democracies and authoritarian regimes, yet a critical difference exists. In democracies, AI-supported surveillance systems operate within a legal framework based on a human rights-inspired approach, while in authoritarian regimes, they are used to detect and suppress dissenting elements." However, the infrastructure is identical; only the governance framework differs—and frameworks can change.
</Aside>

**China's Digital Silk Road**

[Research on digital authoritarianism](https://www.techpolicy.press/autocrats-digital-advances-underscore-the-need-for-civil-society/) documents that "through its Digital Silk Road initiative, China has become an exporter of digital authoritarianism and a major digital infrastructure provider to developing and authoritarian states. Instances of digital authoritarianism can be observed in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, the Philippines, and Thailand."

This represents not just individual authoritarian regimes locking in their values, but the export of surveillance infrastructure that enables other regimes to do the same—a meta-level lock-in mechanism.

### The Moral Stagnation Risk

Even without malicious intent, AI systems may freeze moral progress by encoding current values into long-lived infrastructure:

[Research on evolutionary ethics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15289521/) found that "there are core values around which most people would agree that are unlikely to change over long time periods. However, there are also secondary or derived values around which there is much more controversy and within which differences of view occur."

The problem is distinguishing core from derived values. History shows that many values once considered "core" (divine right of kings, subordination of women, racial hierarchy) were eventually recognized as contingent. AI systems encoding 2025 values cannot distinguish which will prove enduring and which should evolve.

| Historical Example | Once "Core" Value | Current Status | Timeline |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Slavery** | Property rights in humans | Universally condemned | ~200 years |
| **Women's rights** | Male authority over women | Gender equality (partial) | ~150 years |
| **LGBTQ+ rights** | Heteronormativity | Expanding recognition | ~50 years |
| **Animal welfare** | Human supremacy | Growing moral consideration | Ongoing |
| **Future examples?** | Values we consider "obvious" today | May be condemned by 2125 | Unknown |

[ArXiv research on AI and moral enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_and_moral_enhancement) lists concerns that "moral progress might be hindered, and that dependence on AI systems to perform moral reasoning would not only neglect the cultivation of moral excellence but actively undermine it, exposing people to risks of disengagement, of atrophy of human faculties, and of moral manipulation."

<Aside type="note" title="Expertise Atrophy">
Just as GPS navigation reduces spatial reasoning skills, reliance on AI for moral judgments may atrophy human moral reasoning capacity. If future generations depend on AI systems for ethical guidance, they may lose the capacity to recognize when those systems encode outdated or harmful values—making lock-in permanent even if technically reversible.
</Aside>

### Identity Consolidation in AI Systems

[Recent research on AGI development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190) proposes "The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI." The paper notes that "large language models remain broadly open and highly steerable, accepting arbitrary system prompts and adopting multiple personae."

However, "by analogy to human development, the authors hypothesize that progress toward AGI involves a lock-in phase: a transition from open imitation to identity consolidation, where goal structures, refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable and resistant to external steering."

The risk is that "sleeper-agent work shows deceptive backdoors can persist through safety training, underscoring the risk of locking in undesirable traits."

This suggests that as AI systems become more capable, they may naturally undergo value consolidation—transitioning from malleable systems that can represent multiple perspectives to stable systems with fixed values. If this transition happens without deliberate design, the locked-in values will be whichever happened to be present during the consolidation phase.

## Intervention Strategies and Challenges

### Technical Interventions

**1. Pluralistic Alignment Methods**

[Research proposes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05070) moving beyond single-value alignment to pluralistic approaches:

- **Preference Matching RLHF**: Replaces KL-regularization with preference matching to avoid preference collapse
- **Distributional Calibration**: Ensure model outputs match population value distribution
- **Steerable Systems**: Allow users to specify which values to prioritize in different contexts

<Aside type="tip" title="Overton Windows for AI">
One promising approach is "Overton pluralistic models" that present a spectrum of reasonable responses rather than single answers. This preserves value diversity while filtering extreme outliers. However, defining "reasonable" requires meta-level value judgments that themselves could be biased.
</Aside>

**2. Value Updating Mechanisms**

To prevent permanent lock-in, AI systems need mechanisms for updating values as moral understanding improves:

| Mechanism | Approach | Challenge |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Periodic Retraining** | Retrain models on updated value distributions | Expensive; may introduce new biases |
| **Dynamic Fine-tuning** | Continuously update based on new feedback | Vulnerable to manipulation |
| **Constitutional AI** | Encode meta-values (e.g., "be open to moral progress") | Difficult to specify without circularity |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Require human oversight for value-critical decisions | Does not scale; humans may have biased judgment |

[World Economic Forum guidance](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/10/ai-value-alignment-how-we-can-align-artificial-intelligence-with-human-values/) emphasizes that "value alignment involves continuously monitoring and updating AI systems to ensure they adapt to evolving societal norms and ethical standards."

**3. Cultural Sensitivity by Design**

[WEF research](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_AI_Value_Alignment_2024.pdf) advocates for tailored approaches: "Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all model, AI developers must consider the unique cultural, legal and societal contexts in which their AI systems operate."

Example: In credit scoring, "fairness might mean different things depending on the cultural context—in some societies, creditworthiness is linked to community trust and social standing; in others, it is purely a function of individual financial behaviour."

### Governance Interventions

**1. International Standards and Frameworks**

| Standard | Scope | Status | Effectiveness |
|----------|-------|--------|---------------|
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | AI management systems | Published 2023 | Voluntary; limited adoption |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management framework | Published 2023 | US-focused; no enforcement |
| **UNESCO Recommendation** | Global AI ethics principles | Adopted 2021 | Non-binding; variable implementation |
| **EU AI Act** | Comprehensive regulation | Enacted 2024 | Regional; extraterritorial effect unclear |

**2. Surveillance Governance**

[Fourth Amendment research](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/jcl/vol27/iss5/4/) argues that "courts assessing whether networked camera or other sensor systems implicate the Fourth Amendment should account for the risks of unregulated, permeating surveillance by AI agents."

However, legal frameworks struggle to keep pace with technological capabilities. Even in democracies, the infrastructure for authoritarian surveillance exists; only policy prevents its use—and policy can change.

**3. Value Representation in Development**

The [World Economic Forum framework](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/10/ai-value-alignment-how-we-can-align-artificial-intelligence-with-human-values/) emphasizes that "on the technical side, tools such as 'reinforcement learning from human feedback' allow developers to integrate human values directly into AI systems. Meanwhile, value-sensitive design methods help engineers embed ethical considerations into the core architecture of AI systems from the outset."

Critical challenges:
- **Representative sampling**: RLHF annotators not demographically representative
- **Power imbalances**: Dominant groups' values overrepresented in training data
- **Economic incentives**: Cheap annotation prioritized over representative sampling

### Why Interventions May Fail

<Aside type="caution" title="The Trilemma">
Values lock-in presents a trilemma: (1) Encode specific values → Risk locking in wrong values; (2) Remain value-neutral → Impossible; systems must optimize something; (3) Implement pluralism → May reduce capability or create internal conflicts. No option is clearly safe.
</Aside>

| Intervention | Failure Mode | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pluralistic alignment** | Computational cost; reduced performance; hard to implement | Medium-High |
| **Value updating mechanisms** | Vulnerable to manipulation; expensive; may introduce new biases | High |
| **International standards** | Non-binding; variable adoption; lack enforcement | High |
| **Surveillance regulation** | Infrastructure already deployed; policy can be reversed | Medium-High |
| **Representative development** | Economic incentives favor speed over representation | High |

The fundamental challenge is temporal mismatch: Lock-in occurs gradually through accumulation of individually rational decisions, while intervention requires coordination and sacrifice of short-term advantages. By the time the problem is obvious, path dependencies make reversal prohibitively expensive.

## Open Questions

<Aside type="note" title="Key Uncertainties">
These questions represent the highest-value areas for follow-up research and policy development.
</Aside>

| Question | Why It Matters | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Can pluralistic alignment scale to frontier models?** | Need to know if technical solutions are feasible | Proof-of-concept only; unclear if scales |
| **What values should guide AI in absence of consensus?** | Core philosophical question | Deep disagreement persists |
| **How fast do value-encoding path dependencies form?** | Determines intervention window | Unknown; may already be late |
| **Can deployed surveillance infrastructure be dismantled?** | Determines reversibility of authoritarian lock-in | Historical precedent weak |
| **Will moral philosophy converge on answers?** | If yes, lock-in may resolve naturally | Pace too slow; 2,500 years without consensus |
| **Do humans need to practice moral reasoning to maintain competence?** | If yes, AI assistance may cause expertise atrophy | Evidence from other domains suggests yes |
| **Can feedback loops be broken once established?** | Determines if AI-human belief cycles are reversible | No empirical evidence yet |
| **Will AGI undergo identity consolidation?** | If yes, pluralistic alignment window may be narrow | Theoretical hypothesis; not tested |

## AI Transition Model Context

<Aside type="tip" title="Model Integration">
This research connects to multiple factors in the AI Transition Model. Values lock-in represents a long-term trajectory failure mode where civilizational competence proves insufficient to maintain moral progress and value pluralism. The mechanisms identified—RLHF bias, feedback loops, surveillance infrastructure—represent specific causal pathways through which AI development leads to value entrenchment.
</Aside>

### Connections to Other Model Elements

| Model Element | Relationship to Values Lock-in |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **AI Capabilities (Algorithms)** | More capable models have stronger influence on belief formation |
| **AI Capabilities (Adoption)** | Rapid adoption embeds value-laden systems before pluralism achieved |
| **AI Ownership (Companies)** | Small number of labs control value specification decisions |
| **AI Ownership (Countries)** | Western dominance creates cultural bias in value alignment |
| **AI Uses (Governments)** | Surveillance infrastructure enables authoritarian value enforcement |
| **AI Uses (Coordination)** | Feedback loops between users and models create echo chambers |
| **Civilizational Competence (Epistemics)** | Poor epistemic health makes value lock-in harder to detect |
| **Civilizational Competence (Governance)** | Weak governance allows deployment without value pluralism safeguards |
| **Civilizational Competence (Adaptability)** | Moral reasoning atrophy reduces capacity to recognize bad lock-in |
| **Misalignment Potential (Technical AI Safety)** | RLHF bias and preference collapse are technical failure modes |
| **Long-term Lock-in (Political Power)** | Authoritarian surveillance locks in both values and political control |
| **Long-term Lock-in (Economic Power)** | Concentrated AI ownership determines whose values get encoded |

### Key Insights for the Model

1. **Values lock-in is symmetric**: Unlike misalignment or misuse risks, values lock-in could preserve beneficial values or entrench harmful ones. The risk is not from encoding *wrong* values but from making *any* values permanent.

2. **Technical necessity forces premature resolution**: AI systems require objective functions, forcing developers to resolve unresolved philosophical questions. This creates pressure toward lock-in regardless of intention.

3. **Multiple reinforcing mechanisms**: RLHF bias, feedback loops, surveillance infrastructure, and investment concentration create mutually reinforcing dynamics that accelerate lock-in.

4. **Cultural bias is systemic**: Western, English-speaking, Protestant European values disproportionately represented. This is not intentional discrimination but structural consequence of training data and developer demographics.

5. **Surveillance infrastructure enables enforcement**: Authoritarian regimes use AI not just to monitor but to shape behavior, internalizing desired values through fear and conformity.

6. **Intervention window may be narrow**: Research suggests standard alignment reduces pluralism by 30-40%. Each year of deployment creates path dependencies. The window for developing pluralistic alternatives narrows as systems accumulate.

7. **Moral uncertainty is fundamental**: No consensus exists on which values are correct. Forcing premature resolution through technical necessity risks locking in whichever view happens to dominate AI development in the 2020s—foreclosing future moral progress.

The research suggests values lock-in should be considered a high-probability failure mode that receives insufficient attention because it emerges from individually rational decisions (users prefer aligned content; models improve by learning from users) that accumulate into catastrophic loss of value diversity and moral progress capacity.

## Overview

Prediction markets are platforms where participants trade contracts based on future event outcomes, with prices reflecting aggregate probability estimates. These markets outperform traditional polling by 60-75% in elections, achieving Brier scores of 0.16-0.24 on political events. Current market volumes range from $100M+ (Kalshi) to $1-3B annually (Polymarket), indicating growing mainstream adoption despite regulatory constraints.

For [epistemic infrastructure](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/epistemic-infrastructure/), prediction markets offer unique advantages: they incentivize accuracy over ideology, aggregate dispersed information efficiently, and provide calibrated real-time probability estimates. Research by [Berg et al. (2008)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40506242) and [Wolfers & Zitzewitz (2004)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330041371321) demonstrates their superior performance in information aggregation compared to expert polls or surveys.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Accuracy Improvement** | High impact | 15-25% better than polls; Brier scores 0.16-0.24 | Active now |
| **Liquidity Constraints** | Medium risk | $10-50K can move small market prices 5%+ | Ongoing issue |
| **Regulatory Barriers** | High risk | Limited US adoption; fragmented jurisdiction | 2-5 years to resolve |
| **Manipulation Vulnerability** | Low-medium risk | Well-funded actors can temporarily distort prices | Varies by market size |
| **AI Integration Disruption** | Medium risk | AI traders may outcompete humans | 1-3 years |

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Annual Volume | Jurisdiction | Accuracy (Brier) | Primary Focus |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) | $1-3B | Offshore/crypto | 0.16-0.22 | Politics, current events |
| [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) | $100-300M | US (CFTC regulated) | 0.18-0.24 | Economics, politics |
| [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com/) | $50B+ | UK/EU | 0.16-0.20 | Sports, politics |
| [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/) | Play money | Global | 0.15-0.19 | Science, technology, AI |

## Current State & Applications

### Real-Money Markets

**Regulatory landscape**: The US maintains strict regulations through the [CFTC](https://www.cftc.gov/), limiting real-money markets to platforms like Kalshi with narrow question sets. Polymarket operates offshore using cryptocurrency, capturing $1-3B in annual volume. The UK and EU allow broader prediction markets through established platforms like Betfair.

**Growth trajectory**: Polymarket's volume increased 10x from 2023 to 2024, driven by high-profile political events and crypto adoption. Kalshi continues expanding question categories under CFTC oversight.

### Play-Money Platforms

**Metaculus** leads in AI/science forecasting with 15,000+ active forecasters and track records dating to 2015. Research shows [superforecasters](https://www.goodjudgment.com/) on Metaculus achieve Brier scores of 0.15-0.19 on AI timeline questions.

**Manifold Markets** democratizes market creation, allowing users to generate questions on any topic. This creates coverage of niche issues but with lower average accuracy.

### AI Safety Applications

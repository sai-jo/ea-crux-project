## What Are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are platforms where participants trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events. Prices reflect the market's aggregate probability estimate.

**Example**: A contract pays $1 if "AI passes the Turing test by 2030." If the price is $0.35, the market estimates a 35% probability.

**Why this matters for epistemics**: Prediction markets create shared, quantitative forecasts that:
- Aggregate dispersed information
- Incentivize accuracy over ideology
- Provide calibrated probabilities
- Update in real-time as information changes

---

## How They Work

### Basic Mechanism

```
Information holders → Trade on beliefs → Prices emerge → Probability revealed
        ↓                    ↓                ↓                ↓
    Private info        Money at risk    Market clearing    Public signal
```

### Why Prices Reflect Truth

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Incentive alignment** | Make money by being right; lose by being wrong |
| **Marginal trading** | Even small amounts of smart money moves prices |
| **Continuous updating** | Prices respond to new information immediately |
| **Arbitrage** | Mispricings are profit opportunities |

### Types of Prediction Markets

| **Real-money** | Trade with actual currency | Polymarket, Kalshi, PredictIt |
| **Play-money** | Reputation/points only | Metaculus, Manifold |

## Applications for Epistemic Security

### AI Timeline and Risk Forecasting

| Application | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **AI capabilities** | "When will AI achieve X?" |
| **AI safety milestones** | "When will interpretability solve Y?" |
| **Policy outcomes** | "Will regulation Z pass?" |

**Current examples:**
- [Metaculus AI questions](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=artificial%20intelligence)

| Application | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Claim verification** | Market on "Is claim X true?" |

### Decision-Making (Futarchy)

**Concept**: "Vote on values, bet on beliefs" (Robin Hanson)

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Decide on metric to optimize (e.g., GDP, welfare) |
| 2 | Create conditional markets: "Price if policy A" vs "Price if policy B" |
| 3 | Compare market expectations |
| 4 | Implement policy with better expected outcome |

**Status**: Mostly theoretical; small experiments

## Overview

Field-building focuses on **growing the AI safety ecosystem** rather than doing direct research or policy work. The theory is that by increasing the number and quality of people working on AI safety, we multiply the impact of all other interventions.

This is a **meta-level** or **capacity-building** intervention—it doesn't directly solve the technical or governance problems, but creates the infrastructure and talent pipeline that makes solving them possible.

The field has grown substantially: from approximately 400 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in 2022 to roughly 1,100 FTEs in 2025, with technical AI safety organizations growing at 24% annually and non-technical organizations at approximately 30% annually. However, this growth has created new challenges—the pipeline may be over-optimized for researchers while neglecting operations, policy, and other critical roles.

## What Needs to Be True

For field-building to be high impact:

1. **Talent is bottleneck:** More people actually means more progress (vs. "too many cooks")
2. **Sufficient time:** Field-building is multi-year investment; need time before critical period
3. **Quality maintained:** Growth doesn't dilute quality or focus
4. **Absorptive capacity:** Ecosystem can integrate new people
5. **Right people:** Recruiting those with high potential for contribution
6. **Complementarity:** New people enable work that wouldn't happen otherwise

## Key Bottlenecks and Challenges

The AI safety field faces several structural challenges that limit the effectiveness of field-building efforts:

### Pipeline Over-Optimization for Researchers

According to <R id="4a117e76e94af55d">analysis on the EA Forum</R>, the AI safety talent pipeline is over-optimized for researchers:

- The majority of AI safety talent pipelines are optimized for selecting and producing researchers
- Research is not the most neglected talent type in AI safety
- This leads to research-specific talent being over-represented in the community
- Supporting programs strongly select for research skills, missing other crucial roles

**Neglected roles:** Operations, program management, communications, policy implementation, organizational leadership.

### Scaling Gap

There's a massive gap between awareness-level training and the expertise required for selective research fellowships:

- BlueDot plans to train 100,000 people in AI safety fundamentals over 4.5 years
- But few programs bridge from introductory courses to elite research fellowships
- Need scalable programs for the "missing middle"

### Organizational Infrastructure Deficit

- Not enough talented founders are building AI safety organizations
- <R id="bb571705e9f348a4">Catalyze's pilot program</R> incubated 11 organizations, with participants reporting the program accelerated progress by an average of 11 months
- Open positions often don't exist because organizations haven't been founded

### Compensation Competition

AI Safety Institutes and external research struggle to compete with frontier AI companies:
- Frontier companies offer substantially higher compensation packages
- AISIs must appeal to researchers' desire for public service and impact
- Some approaches: joint university appointments, research sabbaticals, rotating fellowships

## AI Transition Model Context

Field building improves the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" /> through multiple factors:

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="safety-capability-gap" /> | Grew field from 400 to 1,100 FTEs (2022-2025) at 21-30% annually |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="alignment-robustness" /> | Training programs achieve 37% career conversion at $5K-40K per career change |
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="institutional-quality" /> | Builds capacity across labs, government, and advocacy organizations |

Key bottleneck is talent pipeline over-optimization for researchers; the field needs more governance, policy, and operations professionals.

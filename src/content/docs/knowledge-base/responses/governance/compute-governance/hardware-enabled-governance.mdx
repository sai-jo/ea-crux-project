## Overview

Hardware-enabled governance mechanisms (HEMs) represent a potentially powerful but controversial approach to AI governance: embedding monitoring and control capabilities directly into the AI chips and computing infrastructure used to train and deploy advanced AI systems. Unlike export controls that prevent initial access to hardware or compute thresholds that trigger regulatory requirements, HEMs would enable ongoing verification and enforcement even after hardware has been deployed.

The appeal is significant. RAND Corporation research argues that HEMs could "provide a new way of limiting the uses of U.S.-designed high-performance microchips" that complements existing controls. If AI governance requires not just knowing who has advanced chips, but verifying how they're used, hardware-level mechanisms offer a potential solution. Remote attestation could verify that chips are running approved workloads; cryptographic licensing could prevent unauthorized large-scale training; geolocation constraints could enforce export controls on a continuing basis.

However, HEMs also raise serious concerns. Privacy implications, security risks from attack surfaces, potential for abuse by authoritarian regimes, and fundamental questions about appropriate scope of surveillance make this a highly contested intervention. Implementation would require unprecedented coordination between governments and chip manufacturers, with unclear technical feasibility for the most ambitious proposals. HEMs represent high-risk, high-reward governance infrastructure that merits serious research while demanding careful attention to safeguards.

## Technical Mechanisms

Hardware-enabled governance encompasses several distinct technical approaches with different capabilities, costs, and risks:

### Mechanism Overview

| Mechanism | Description | Technical Feasibility | Governance Use | Risk Profile |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Remote Attestation** | Cryptographically verify hardware state and software configuration | High | Verify chips running approved firmware | Medium |
| **Secure Enclaves** | Isolated execution environments for sensitive operations | High | Protect governance checks from tampering | Low-Medium |
| **Usage Metering** | On-chip tracking of compute operations | Medium | Monitor for large training runs | Medium |
| **Cryptographic Licensing** | Require digital license for operation | Medium | Control who can use chips | Medium-High |
| **Geolocation** | Track physical location of chips | Medium | Enforce geographic restrictions | High |
| **Remote Disable** | Ability to shut down chips remotely | Medium-High | Enforcement mechanism | Very High |
| **Workload Detection** | Identify specific computation patterns | Low-Medium | Detect prohibited uses | Medium-High |

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Foundation

Many HEM proposals build on existing Trusted Platform Module technology:

| Feature | Current TPM | Enhanced for AI Governance |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Secure boot | Verify startup software | Verify AI framework integrity |
| Attestation | Report device state | Report training workload characteristics |
| Key storage | Protect encryption keys | Store governance credentials |
| Sealed storage | Encrypt to specific state | Bind data to compliance state |

TPMs are already deployed in most modern computers. Extending this infrastructure for AI governance is technically feasible but raises scope and purpose questions.

## RAND Research Framework

RAND Corporation's 2024 working paper provides the most comprehensive public analysis of HEMs for AI governance:

### Proposed Mechanisms

| Mechanism | RAND Assessment | Implementation Path |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Attestation-based licensing** | Most feasible | Build on existing TPM infrastructure |
| **Compute tracking** | Technically challenging | Would require chip redesign |
| **Geographic restrictions** | Moderate feasibility | GPS/network-based verification |
| **Remote disable** | Technically feasible | Requires fail-safe design |

### Design Principles (RAND)

1. **Proportionality**: Governance mechanisms should match risk levels
2. **Minimal intrusiveness**: Collect only necessary information
3. **Fail-safe design**: Errors should default to safe states
4. **International coordination**: Effective only with broad adoption
5. **Abuse prevention**: Strong safeguards against misuse

### Limitations Acknowledged

RAND explicitly notes that HEMs would "provide a complement to, but not a substitute for all, export controls." Key limitations include:
- Cannot prevent all circumvention
- Require ongoing enforcement infrastructure
- Create attack surfaces for adversaries
- May be defeated by determined state actors

## Implementation Considerations

### Current Industry Practices

Some hardware governance already exists:

| Feature | Current Use | AI Governance Extension |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Device attestation** | DRM, enterprise security | Verify compute environment |
| **Remote wipe** | Lost device protection | Enforcement mechanism |
| **Licensing servers** | Software activation | Compute authorization |
| **Firmware updates** | Security patches | Policy updates |
| **Usage telemetry** | Product improvement | Compliance monitoring |

Extending these mechanisms for governance involves primarily scope and purpose changes rather than fundamental technical innovation.

### Required Infrastructure

Effective HEM deployment would require:

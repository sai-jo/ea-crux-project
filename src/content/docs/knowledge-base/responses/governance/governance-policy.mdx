## Summary

AI governance seeks to shape the development and deployment of AI systems through **institutions, regulations, and coordination**. Unlike technical research that solves problems directly, governance creates **guardrails, incentives, and coordination mechanisms** to reduce risk.

This is increasingly seen as **essential** even if technical solutions exist—coordination problems, racing dynamics, and deployment decisions require institutional solutions.

## Theory of Change

```
Policy expertise → Evidence-based proposals → Political advocacy → Regulation/coordination → Changed behavior → Reduced risk
```

**Key mechanisms:**
1. **Information:** Build knowledge of risks and solutions among policymakers
2. **Proposals:** Develop concrete, implementable policy ideas
3. **Advocacy:** Build political coalitions for adoption
4. **Implementation:** Ensure effective execution
5. **Iteration:** Learn from experience and adjust

## Major Intervention Areas

### 1. International Coordination

**Goal:** Prevent race-to-the-bottom dynamics through international agreements and institutions.

**Approaches:**

**AI Safety Summits:**
- Bletchley Park Summit (UK, November 2023)
- Seoul AI Safety Summit (May 2024)
- Paris AI Summit (2024)
- Achieved: Frontier AI Safety Commitments, international dialogue
- Limitations: Non-binding, limited enforcement

**International Institutions:**
- **UN AI Advisory Body:** Proposed governance framework
- **IAEA-like body for AI:** Monitoring and verification (proposed)
- **OECD AI Principles:** Non-binding guidelines
- **G7/G20 AI discussions:** High-level coordination

**Treaty Proposals:**
- Compute governance regimes
- Safety standard harmonization
- Information sharing agreements
- Non-proliferation frameworks

**Theory of change:** International coordination prevents competitive dynamics where labs/nations sacrifice safety for speed.

    { source: "Pessimistic", value: "5-10%", notes: "International cooperation is unlikely or ineffective" },
  ]}
/>

**Tractability concerns:**
- History of arms control is mixed
- China-US coordination especially difficult
- Enforcement mechanisms unclear
- Timeline may be too slow

**Who's working on this:**
- GovAI (now dissolved, merged into Centre for the Governance of AI)
- Centre for the Governance of AI (Oxford)
- Centre for AI Safety and Governance (Stanford)
- UN researchers and advisors
- Think tanks (CSIS, Brookings, CNAS)

### 2. National Regulation

**Goal:** Implement safety requirements, oversight, and accountability within specific jurisdictions.

**Approaches:**

**United States:**

- **Executive Order on AI (October 2023):**
  - Compute reporting requirements (>10^26 FLOP)
  - Safety testing before release
  - DHS oversight and standards
  - NIST AI Safety Institute (AISI)

- **Proposed legislation:**
  - Algorithmic accountability
  - Liability frameworks
  - Licensing requirements for powerful models
  - Whistleblower protections

**European Union:**

- **EU AI Act (2024):**
  - Risk-based classification system
  - Requirements for "high-risk" AI
  - GPAI (General Purpose AI) provisions:
    - Transparency requirements
    - Systemic risk evaluation (>10^25 FLOP)
    - Code of conduct
  - Enforcement through fines (up to 7% of global revenue)

- **Strengths:** Comprehensive, binding, Brussels Effect (global influence)
- **Weaknesses:** May be too slow, overly bureaucratic, limited technical expertise

**United Kingdom:**

- **AI Safety Institute (AISI):**
  - Pre-deployment testing
  - Capability evaluations
  - Safety research
  - International coordination hub

- **Pro-innovation approach:** Light regulation, sector-specific rules
- **Question:** Will this be sufficient for catastrophic risks?

**China:**

- Regulation of generative AI content
- State control over AI development
- Less transparency about safety measures
- Different governance approach (authoritarian)

**Other jurisdictions:**
- Canada, Australia, Japan, Singapore developing approaches
- Global South mostly not engaged yet

**Theory of change:** National regulations create floor for safety standards; competitive jurisdictions create race to the top.

**Tractability:**
- **Medium-High in EU:** Strong regulatory capacity, demonstrated willingness
- **Medium in US:** Divided government, tech industry lobbying, but executive action possible
- **Low in China:** Opaque process, different priorities
- **Varies elsewhere:** Depends on state capacity and political will

**Who's working on this:**
- US AISI (government)
- UK AISI (government)
- Policy advocacy orgs (CAIS, CSET, FLI)
- Think tanks
- Academic policy researchers

### 3. Industry Standards and Self-Regulation

**Goal:** Establish safety commitments and best practices within AI industry.

**Approaches:**

**Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs):**
- Anthropic pioneered framework (2023)
- IF-THEN structure: If capabilities reach level X, THEN implement safeguards Y
- ASL (AI Safety Levels) with corresponding containment
- Other labs developing similar frameworks

**Frontier AI Safety Commitments:**
- Voluntary commitments from major labs (post-Seoul Summit)
- Safety testing before deployment
- Information sharing on risks
- Third-party evaluation access

**Partnership on AI:**
- Industry consortium
- Best practices development
- Limited teeth/enforcement

**Safety standards development:**
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- ISO/IEC AI standards
- Industry-specific guidelines

**Theory of change:** If labs compete on safety (race to the top), self-regulation can work. If they compete only on capabilities (race to the bottom), regulation needed.

- Harder to circumvent than software regulation

**Mechanisms:**

**Export Controls:**
- US restrictions on AI chip exports to China (October 2022, updated)
- NVIDIA A100/H100 restricted
- Lithography equipment controls
- Goal: Slow adversarial AI development

**Compute Thresholds:**
- EU AI Act: 10^25 FLOP triggers requirements
- US EO: 10^26 FLOP requires reporting
- Basis for safety testing obligations

**Know Your Customer (KYC):**
- Cloud providers verify customers
- Report large training runs
- Prevent misuse

**Hardware-level governance (proposed):**
- Chip registration and tracking
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- International verification regimes

**Theory of change:** Control chokepoints in AI supply chain to prevent dangerous development and enable monitoring.

**Tractability:**
- **Higher:** Clear policy mechanisms, existing export control infrastructure
- **Medium-term challenges:** Algorithmic efficiency, distributed training, semiconductor supply chain evolution

**Who's working on this:**
- GovAI researchers (especially Lennart Heim)
- US government (BIS - Bureau of Industry and Security)
- Think tanks (CSET, CNAS)

### 5. Liability and Legal Frameworks

**Goal:** Create accountability through legal liability for AI harms.

**Approaches:**

**Strict Liability:**
- Companies liable for harms caused by their AI
- Incentivizes safety investment
- Challenge: Defining causation for AI systems

**Certification and Licensing:**
- Require license to deploy powerful AI
- Pre-deployment safety testing
- Ongoing monitoring requirements

**Whistleblower Protections:**
- Protect employees who report safety issues
- Reduce information asymmetry
- Enable oversight

**Bounties and Disclosure:**
- Bug bounties for safety issues
- Responsible disclosure frameworks
- Adversarial testing incentives

**Theory of change:** Legal consequences shift cost-benefit calculus toward safety; transparency enables oversight.

**Tractability:**
- **Medium:** Existing legal frameworks, political support for accountability
- **Challenges:** Technical complexity, industry lobbying, international differences

**Who's working on this:**
- Legal scholars
- Policy advocates (CAIS)
- Government attorneys general

## What Needs to Be True

For governance to substantially reduce x-risk:

1. **Sufficient time:** Policy development takes years; need lead time before critical systems
2. **Political will:** Governments/publics must prioritize existential risk
3. **Technical feasibility:** Proposed regulations must be implementable
4. **International coordination:** Major AI powers must cooperate (especially US-China)
5. **Enforcement:** Regulations must be monitored and enforced
6. **Adaptability:** Policies must evolve with technology
7. **Expertise:** Policymakers need sufficient technical understanding

## Estimated Impact by Worldview

### Short Timelines + Technical Difficulty High
**Impact: Critical**
- May be only hope if technical solutions won't arrive in time
- Focus on emergency measures: compute caps, deployment moratoria
- International coordination urgent
- Less time for iterative policy development

### Long Timelines + Technical Difficulty High
**Impact: Very High**
- Time to develop thoughtful governance
- Can coordinate with technical research
- Build robust institutions
- Enable careful testing

### Short Timelines + Technical Difficulty Moderate
**Impact: High**
- Buys time for technical solutions
- Prevents worst competitive dynamics
- Ensures adoption of safety measures
- Complements technical work

### Alignment Easy (Any Timeline)
**Impact: Medium**
- Still need deployment governance
- Prevent misuse and structural risks
- Ensure equitable access
- Less critical than if alignment is hard

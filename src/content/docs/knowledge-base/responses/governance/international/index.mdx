International coordination on AI governance involves efforts by nations, international organizations, and civil society to establish norms, agreements, and institutions for managing AI development globally.

## Key Topics

- [International Summits](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/international/international-summits/) - AI Safety Summits and global gatherings
- [Seoul Declaration](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/international/seoul-declaration/) - 2024 AI Safety commitments

## Challenges

International AI governance faces unique challenges:

1. **Sovereignty concerns** - Nations reluctant to cede control
2. **Verification difficulty** - Hard to monitor AI development
3. **Speed of progress** - Technology outpaces diplomacy
4. **Dual-use nature** - AI benefits and risks intertwined
5. **Competition dynamics** - US-China rivalry complicates cooperation

## Existing Efforts

- **UN initiatives** - Secretary-General's AI Advisory Body
- **G7/G20** - Hiroshima AI Process, discussions on AI governance
- **OECD** - AI Principles and recommendations
- **AI Safety Summits** - Bletchley Park (2023), Seoul (2024), Paris (2025)

## Summary

SB 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, was California state legislation that would have required safety testing and liability measures for developers of the most powerful AI models.

The bill **passed the California legislature** but was **vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom** on September 29, 2024.

SB 1047 was the **most significant AI safety legislation attempted in the United States** to date. Its passage through the legislature demonstrated growing political willingness to regulate frontier AI, while its veto illustrated the political challenges such regulation faces.

## What the Bill Proposed

### Scope: "Covered Models"

The bill would have applied to AI models meeting **any** of these criteria:

**Training Compute:**
- Trained using >10^26 FLOP (floating-point operations)
- Approximately GPT-4.5/Claude 3 Opus scale or larger

**Training Cost:**
- Cost >$100 million to train
- Adjusted annually for inflation

**Fine-tuned Models:**
- Fine-tuning cost >$10 million
- Based on a covered model

**Why these thresholds?**
- Target only frontier models from well-resourced labs
- Exclude open-source models and academic research
- Align with international compute governance efforts (US EO, EU AI Act)

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Safety Testing Before Training

**Pre-Training Requirements:**

Developers must:
- Determine whether model will be a "covered model"
- Implement safety protocols before beginning training
- Establish shutdown procedures

**Covered Model Determination:**

If expected to meet thresholds:
- Document safety plan
- Prepare for testing requirements
- Establish compliance measures

#### 2. Hazardous Capability Testing

**Required Testing:**

Before deployment or making available to third parties, test for:

**Critical Harm Capabilities:**
- Creation of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons (CBRN)
- Mass casualty cyber attacks (>$500M damage or mass casualties)
- Autonomous operation and self-exfiltration
- Self-improvement and recursive self-modification

**Testing Methods:**
- Red-team testing
- Adversarial probing
- Capability evaluations
- Third-party auditing

**Threshold:** Model enables non-expert to cause mass casualties or >$500M in damage.

#### 3. Safety and Security Protocol

**Required Measures:**

Developers must implement:

**Cybersecurity:**

## Path Through Legislature

### Initial Introduction (February 2024)

**Original Sponsors:**
- Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco)
- Support from AI safety advocates
- Opposed by major AI companies and some researchers

### Amendment Process

**Major Changes:**
- Narrowed scope to truly frontier models
- Added safe harbors and affirmative defenses
- Reduced liability provisions
- Clarified open-source exemptions
- Specified hazardous capabilities more precisely

**Purpose of Amendments:**
- Address industry concerns about overbreadth
- Balance innovation and safety
- Build coalition for passage

### Legislative Passage

**August 29, 2024: Passed California Legislature**
- Assembly: 45-11
- Senate: 32-1
- Bipartisan support
- Most significant AI legislation to pass any US state legislature

### Veto (September 29, 2024)

**Governor Newsom's Rationale:**

"While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it."

**Specific Concerns:**
- Focus on model size rather than deployment context
- Could stifle innovation
- Regulatory approach not nuanced enough
- Preferred federal regulation

**Accompanying Actions:**

Newsom simultaneously:
- Signed 18 other AI bills on narrower topics
- Called for federal AI legislation
- Committed to working with legislature on alternative approaches

## Summary

SB 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, was California state legislation that would have required safety testing and liability measures for developers of the most powerful AI models.

The bill **passed the California legislature** but was **vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom** on September 29, 2024.

SB 1047 was the **most significant AI safety legislation attempted in the United States** to date. Its passage through the legislature demonstrated growing political willingness to regulate frontier AI, while its veto illustrated the political challenges such regulation faces.

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Tractability** | Medium | Passed legislature (Assembly 45-11, Senate 32-1) but vetoed; demonstrated political feasibility with refinement |
| **Effectiveness** | Medium-High (if enacted) | Would have created enforceable requirements for frontier AI safety testing, shutdown capabilities, and incident reporting |
| **Political Viability** | Low-Medium | Strong industry opposition including safety-focused labs; governor cited innovation concerns; federal approach preferred |
| **Enforcement Mechanism** | Strong | Attorney General enforcement with civil penalties up to 10% of training costs; whistleblower protections; mandatory auditing |
| **Coverage** | Narrow | Only frontier models >10^26 FLOP or >$100M training cost; exempted open-source and academic research |
| **Status** | Vetoed (Sept 29, 2024) | Legislative success followed by executive veto; precedent for future state/federal legislation |

## What the Bill Proposed

### Scope: "Covered Models"

The bill would have applied to AI models meeting **any** of these criteria:

**Training Compute:**
- Trained using >10^26 FLOP (floating-point operations)
- Approximately GPT-4.5/Claude 3 Opus scale or larger
- Threshold [aligned with US Executive Order 14110](https://www.fenwick.com/insights/publications/interesting-developments-for-regulatory-thresholds-of-ai-compute) on AI safety

**Training Cost:**
- Cost >$100 million to train
- Adjusted annually for inflation
- At current cloud compute prices, 10^26 FLOP costs approximately [$70-100 million](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/08/californias-sb-1047-would-impose-new-safety-requirements-for-developers-of-large-scale-ai-models) (Anthropic estimate)

**Fine-tuned Models:**
- Fine-tuning cost >$10 million
- Based on a covered model

**Why these thresholds?**
- Target only frontier models from well-resourced labs
- Exclude open-source models and academic research
- Align with international compute governance efforts (US EO, EU AI Act)

### Provisions Comparison Table

| Requirement Category | Specific Provision | Timing | Penalty for Non-Compliance | Comparison to Alternatives |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Safety Testing** | Red-team testing for CBRN weapons, cyber attacks >$500M damage, autonomous operation | Before deployment or third-party access | Civil penalties up to 10% of training costs | Stricter than voluntary commitments (Anthropic RSP, OpenAI Preparedness); similar scope to US EO requirements |
| **Shutdown Capability** | Full shutdown of all instances including during training | Before beginning training | AG enforcement + injunctive relief | Unique requirement; not in US EO, EU AI Act, or industry frameworks |
| **Cybersecurity** | Protection of model weights from theft; secure infrastructure; incident response | Before training begins | Civil liability for security breaches | Similar to US EO reporting but with enforcement teeth |
| **Third-Party Auditing** | Annual independent audits starting Jan 1, 2026; 5-year record retention | Annually after Jan 1, 2026 | Civil penalties for audit failures | More stringent than US EO (voluntary); weaker than EU AI Act (ongoing) |
| **Incident Reporting** | Report AI safety incidents to AG within 72 hours | Within 72 hours of incident | Civil penalties + potential criminal referral | Faster timeline than US EO (unspecified); AG enforcement vs. federal agencies |
| **Whistleblower Protection** | Prohibit retaliation; anonymous reporting process; 7-year complaint retention | Immediate; ongoing | Labor Commissioner enforcement + civil damages | Stronger than industry standards; similar to federal whistleblower laws |
| **Compute Cluster Reporting** | Clusters >10^26 ops/second must report to state; customer information required | Ongoing for CA-based clusters | Civil penalties for non-reporting | Similar to US EO compute reporting but state-level jurisdiction |
| **Liability Framework** | Affirmative defense for compliance; AG can sue for violations causing harm | Post-deployment if harm occurs | Up to 10% of training costs + damages | Softer than strict liability (original draft); stronger than status quo |

**Key Enforcement Mechanisms:**

The diagram shows three primary enforcement pathways in SB 1047:

1. **Preventive Compliance Path** (top): Developers who implement all requirements and pass audits receive affirmative defense from liability
2. **Incident Response Path** (bottom): Safety incidents trigger mandatory 72-hour reporting and Attorney General investigation
3. **Penalty Path** (right): Non-compliance or violation results in civil penalties up to 10% of training costs plus potential injunctive relief

The bill created overlapping accountability through third-party auditing (annual), whistleblower protections (continuous), and incident reporting (reactive), ensuring multiple mechanisms to detect non-compliance.

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Safety Testing Before Training

**Pre-Training Requirements:**

Developers must:
- Determine whether model will be a "covered model"
- Implement safety protocols before beginning training
- Establish shutdown procedures

**Covered Model Determination:**

If expected to meet thresholds:
- Document safety plan
- Prepare for testing requirements
- Establish compliance measures

#### 2. Hazardous Capability Testing

**Required Testing:**

Before deployment or making available to third parties, test for:

**Critical Harm Capabilities:**
- Creation of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons (CBRN)
- Mass casualty cyber attacks (>$500M damage or mass casualties)
- Autonomous operation and self-exfiltration
- Self-improvement and recursive self-modification

**Testing Methods:**
- Red-team testing
- Adversarial probing
- Capability evaluations
- Third-party auditing

**Threshold:** Model enables non-expert to cause mass casualties or >$500M in damage.

#### 3. Safety and Security Protocol

**Required Measures:**

Developers must implement:

**Cybersecurity:**
- Protection of model weights from theft

#### 6. Liability Framework

**Affirmative Defense:**

Developers protected from liability if:
- Complied with all safety requirements
- Conducted reasonable testing
- Implemented safety protocols
- Acted in good faith

**Strict Liability Removed:**

Does NOT create automatic liability for harms; must prove negligence or non-compliance.

**Attorney General Enforcement:**

California AG can sue for:
- Violations of safety requirements
- Civil penalties up to 10% of training costs
- Injunctive relief

#### 7. Compute Cluster Reporting

### Veto (September 29, 2024)

**Governor Newsom's Rationale:**

From [Newsom's official veto message](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SB-1047-Veto-Message.pdf):

"While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it."

Additional concerns: "Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047."

**Specific Concerns:**
- Focus on model size rather than deployment context
- Could stifle innovation in California's tech sector
- Regulatory approach not nuanced enough (described as not "informed by an empirical trajectory analysis")
- Preferred federal regulation given interstate nature of AI

**Accompanying Actions:**

Newsom simultaneously:
- Signed 18 other AI bills on narrower topics (deepfakes, discrimination, transparency)
- Called for federal AI legislation to address interstate nature of technology
- Committed to working with legislature on alternative approaches
- Convened expert panel including Fei-Fei Li (Stanford), Tino Cuéllar (Carnegie Endowment), and Jennifer Tour Chayes (UC Berkeley) to develop "empirical, science-based trajectory analysis"

## Support and Opposition

## Technical and Policy Debates

### Size-Based vs. Risk-Based Regulation

**Size-Based (SB 1047 Approach):**

**Pros:**
- Objective, measurable thresholds
- Targets most capable models
- Easier to enforce
- Aligns with international compute governance

**Cons:**
- Doesn't capture deployment context
- Could miss dangerous applications of smaller models
- Algorithmic efficiency makes thresholds obsolete

**Risk-Based (Newsom's Preference):**

**Pros:**
- Focuses on actual harm potential
- Context-appropriate
- Adapts to changing technology

**Cons:**
- Harder to define and measure
- Enforcement challenges
- Potentially broader scope (privacy, fairness, etc.)
- Risk assessment subjective

**Synthesis Possible:**
- Combination of both approaches
- Size thresholds trigger risk assessments
- Deployment context determines requirements

### Liability Questions

**SB 1047 Approach:**
- Affirmative defense for compliance
- Attorney General enforcement
- Civil penalties

**Debate:**
- Too much liability deters innovation?
- Too little fails to ensure safety?
- Who should bear costs of AI harms?

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Strict liability with caps
- Insurance requirements
- Tiered liability based on precautions
- No-fault compensation schemes

### Open Source Implications

**SB 1047 Exemption:**
- Open-source models exempt unless developer profits >$50M from derivatives

**Concerns Raised:**
- Could still chill open-source development
- Uncertainty about liability
- Derivative work tracking difficult

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Exemption was broad
- Open-source not inherently safe
- Need some oversight of powerful models

**Ongoing Debate:**
- How to encourage open research while managing risks
- Different models for different risk levels
- Role of open-source in AI safety ecosystem

## Comparison to Other Policies

### vs. US Executive Order

The [compute thresholds in SB 1047 were deliberately aligned](https://www.fenwick.com/insights/publications/interesting-developments-for-regulatory-thresholds-of-ai-compute) with Biden's Executive Order 14110.

**Similarities:**
- Compute thresholds (10^26 FLOP for training)
- Safety testing requirements for CBRN risks
- Focus on frontier models only
- Developer reporting obligations

**Differences:**
- SB 1047 had enforcement teeth (civil penalties up to 10% of training costs, AG lawsuits)
- EO has broader scope (government use, competition policy, immigration for AI talent)
- SB 1047 state-level mandatory law; EO federal executive action (can be rescinded)
- SB 1047 required shutdown capability (unique provision)
- SB 1047 included third-party auditing requirement (EO relies on voluntary compliance)

**Relationship:**
- SB 1047 would have complemented EO with state-level enforcement
- State enforcement of federal principles with local adaptation
- Potential model for other states considering AI legislation
- [Analysis from legal firms](https://www.gibsondunn.com/regulating-the-future-eight-key-takeaways-from-californias-sb-1047-vetoed-by-governor-newsom/) noted SB 1047 went further than EO on liability

### vs. EU AI Act

**EU Act:**
- Risk categories for deployed systems
- Broader scope (not just frontier models)
- Binding regulation with large fines

**SB 1047:**
- Narrower focus on frontier models
- More specific technical requirements (shutdown, testing)
- State-level vs. EU-wide

**Lessons:**
- EU's comprehensiveness politically difficult in US
- SB 1047's focused approach still failed
- Suggests US regulation will be patchwork

### vs. Voluntary Commitments

**Industry Commitments:**
- No enforcement
- Self-defined standards
- Flexible and adaptive

**SB 1047:**
- Mandatory requirements
- State enforcement
- Specific standards

**Debate:**
- Is voluntary compliance sufficient?
- Does regulation stifle beneficial innovation?
- Can industry self-regulate emerging risks?

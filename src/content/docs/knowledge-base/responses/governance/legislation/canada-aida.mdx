## Summary

The **Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA)** was Canada's proposed federal AI legislation, introduced as Part 3 of **Bill C-27** (the Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022). Despite years of debate and amendment, the bill **died on the order paper** when Parliament was dissolved in January 2025.

AIDA would have been Canada's first comprehensive AI law, establishing requirements for "high-impact" AI systems. Its failure illustrates the challenges of passing AI legislation even in countries broadly supportive of regulation.

## What AIDA Proposed

### Scope: High-Impact AI Systems

AIDA would have applied to AI systems that could have a **significant impact** on individuals in areas including:

- Employment and hiring decisions
- Services, benefits, or opportunities
- Health, safety, or human rights
- Economic interests

**Exclusions:**
- National security and defense AI
- AI systems for personal/household use
- Basic automation not involving AI

### Key Requirements

#### For All High-Impact Systems

1. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential harms
   - Assess likelihood and severity
   - Document mitigation measures

2. **Mitigation Measures**
   - Implement safeguards against identified risks
   - Monitor effectiveness
   - Update as necessary

3. **Transparency**
   - Publish plain-language descriptions
   - Explain how system makes decisions
   - Notify individuals when AI used for decisions

4. **Human Oversight**
   - Maintain appropriate human involvement
   - Enable human review of AI decisions
   - Ensure accountability

#### Additional Requirements

**Record-keeping:**
- Maintain records of assessments, measures, and decisions
- Retain for prescribed periods
- Make available to regulators on request

**Reporting:**
- Report serious harms to AI and Data Commissioner
- Notify affected individuals of harmful decisions
- Disclose to Minister as required

### Prohibited Conduct

AIDA would have made it an offense to:
- Possess or use AI systems causing **serious harm** (knowing or reckless)
- Make AI systems available knowing they could cause serious harm
- Use AI systems in ways that contravene regulations

**Penalties:** Up to $10 million or 3% of global revenue (whichever higher)

### Enforcement Structure

**AI and Data Commissioner:**
- New office to be created
- Oversight and enforcement authority
- Compliance orders and penalties
- Research and guidance functions

**Minister's Powers:**
- Make regulations defining key terms
- Specify requirements for different AI categories
- Audit and inspection authority

## Criticisms and Controversy

### "Framework Legislation" Concerns

**The Problem:** AIDA was criticized as **"framework legislation"**—a skeleton law with most substance left to future regulations.

Key terms left undefined:
- "High-impact AI system" (to be defined by regulation)
- "Significant harm" (to be defined by regulation)
- "Biased output" (to be defined by regulation)

**Critics argued:**
- Parliament delegating too much authority to executive
- Insufficient democratic oversight of key decisions
- Industry could influence regulations behind closed doors
- Uncertainty for businesses about actual requirements

### Industry Concerns

**Compliance burden:**
- Unclear requirements until regulations written
- Potentially broad scope of "high-impact" definition
- Documentation and assessment costs

**International competitiveness:**
- More restrictive than US approach (no federal law)
- Less detailed than EU AI Act
- Uncertainty discourages investment

### Civil Society Concerns

**Inadequate protections:**
- Criminal prohibition only for "serious harm" (high bar)
- No private right of action for individuals
- Weak enforcement mechanisms
- Exemptions for government AI

**Accountability gaps:**
- Commissioner not independent enough
- Limited transparency requirements
- No algorithmic impact assessments for government

### Technical Concerns

**Definition challenges:**
- How to define "AI system" precisely?
- What makes impact "high" vs. low?
- How to assess potential harms prospectively?

## Legislative Journey

### 2022: Introduction

- June 16, 2022: Bill C-27 introduced (includes AIDA as Part 3)
- Combines consumer privacy reform (CPPA), data mobility, and AI regulation
- First reading passed

### 2023: Committee Study

- Committee hearings begin
- Significant criticism from experts and stakeholders
- Government announces major amendments planned

**Proposed Amendments (November 2023):**
- Added "general-purpose AI system" (GPAI) provisions
- New requirements for GPAI providers
- Strengthened transparency requirements
- Clarified "high-impact" definition criteria

### 2024: Continued Delays

- Amendments introduced but not yet voted
- Political attention on other priorities
- Election timing uncertainty
- Growing concern bill would die without passage

### 2025: Bill Dies

- January 2025: Parliament dissolved for election
- Bill C-27 dies on order paper
- All progress lost; would need to be reintroduced

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Feature | AIDA (proposed) | EU AI Act | US (federal) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Status | Failed | In force | No comprehensive law |
| Approach | Framework + regulations | Detailed requirements | Sectoral/state |
| Risk tiers | High-impact only | 4 tiers (unacceptable → minimal) | N/A |
| Prohibited systems | Criminal offense for serious harm | Explicit prohibited list | N/A |
| Enforcement | AI Commissioner | National authorities | Varies |
| GPAI provisions | Added in amendments | Yes | N/A |

## Lessons from AIDA's Failure

### Political Challenges

1. **Omnibus bills are risky** - Bundling AI with privacy reform complicated passage
2. **Framework legislation creates uncertainty** - Vague laws attract criticism from all sides
3. **Timing matters** - Election cycles can kill years of work
4. **AI is not priority** - Competes with other legislative priorities

### Substantive Challenges

1. **Defining AI is hard** - Any definition risks over/under-inclusion
2. **Risk assessment is complex** - Prospective harm evaluation is genuinely difficult
3. **Balancing interests** - Industry vs. civil society vs. government interests conflict
4. **International coordination** - Pressure to align with EU, differ from China, etc.

### Governance Challenges

1. **Regulatory capacity** - Creating new commissioner/office is resource-intensive
2. **Technical expertise** - Government struggles to hire AI experts
3. **Keeping current** - Technology changes faster than law

## What Happens Now

### Short-term (2025)

- New government will need to decide whether to reintroduce
- Could introduce similar bill, different approach, or nothing
- Provincial action may fill vacuum (Quebec, Ontario considering AI laws)

### Possible Futures

**Scenario 1: AIDA Redux**
- New government reintroduces similar legislation
- Potentially incorporates lessons from EU AI Act implementation
- 2-3 more years before potential passage

**Scenario 2: Different Approach**
- Sectoral regulation instead of comprehensive law
- Focus on specific use cases (employment, healthcare)
- Faster to implement but fragmented

**Scenario 3: Wait and See**
- No new federal legislation
- Rely on existing laws and provincial action
- Watch how EU AI Act implementation proceeds

**Scenario 4: Voluntary Framework**
- Government issues guidance without legislation
- Industry self-regulation with government endorsement
- Lower compliance burden but weaker protections

## Significance

AIDA's failure matters because:

1. **Canada was early** - One of first countries to propose comprehensive AI law
2. **G7 member** - Canadian approach influences international norms
3. **AI hub** - Significant AI research community (Toronto, Montreal)
4. **Cautionary tale** - Illustrates difficulty of passing AI legislation

**For AI governance:** AIDA's failure shows that even countries broadly supportive of AI regulation face significant obstacles. The EU AI Act's success is not easily replicated.

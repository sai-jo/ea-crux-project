## Overview

The EU AI Act represents the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence regulation, entering force on August 1, 2024. This landmark legislation establishes a risk-based regulatory approach that categorizes AI systems by potential harm, with increasingly stringent requirements for higher-risk applications. The Act fundamentally reshapes the AI landscape by introducing binding legal obligations for AI developers and deployers operating in European markets.

From an AI safety perspective, the Act introduces groundbreaking provisions for [general-purpose AI models](/knowledge-base/foundation-models/large-language-models/) trained with more than 10^25 floating-point operations. These systems must undergo mandatory adversarial testing, comprehensive risk assessments, and continuous monitoring for dangerous capabilities. The legislation creates crucial precedents that influence regulatory discussions globally, with enforcement mechanisms including penalties up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.

The Act's enforcement establishes the EU AI Office as a dedicated regulatory body for advanced AI oversight. While primarily focused on near-term harms rather than [existential risks](/knowledge-base/risks/), its framework for monitoring advanced AI capabilities provides important infrastructure for addressing severe risks as systems become increasingly powerful.

## Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk Category | Classification Criteria | Key Requirements | Penalty Range |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Prohibited** | Unacceptable risk to fundamental rights | Complete ban on deployment | €35M or 7% revenue |
| **High-Risk** | Critical infrastructure, employment, law enforcement | Conformity assessment, human oversight, documentation | €15M or 3% revenue |
| **GPAI Systemic** | >10^25 FLOP training threshold | Red-teaming, incident reporting, cybersecurity | €35M or 7% revenue |
| **Limited Risk** | Transparency concerns (chatbots, deepfakes) | Disclosure requirements | €7.5M or 1.5% revenue |

### Prohibited AI Systems

The Act bans AI practices deemed to pose unacceptable risks to fundamental rights and safety:

- **Social scoring systems** by governments (modeled after concerns about China's social credit system)
- **Real-time remote biometric identification** in publicly accessible spaces (limited law enforcement exceptions)
- **Subliminal manipulation techniques** exploiting vulnerabilities of specific groups
- **Emotional manipulation** targeting children or vulnerable populations

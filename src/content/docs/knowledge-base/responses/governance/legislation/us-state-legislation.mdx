## Summary

In the absence of comprehensive federal AI legislation, **US states have become laboratories for AI governance**. As of 2024, hundreds of AI-related bills have been introduced across all 50 states, with several significant laws enacted.

## Enacted Legislation

### Colorado AI Act (SB 21-205)
**Status**: Enacted May 2024, effective February 2026

First comprehensive state AI law. Requires:
- Algorithmic impact assessments
- Consumer disclosures for high-risk AI decisions
- Discrimination prevention measures

### Illinois AI Video Interview Act (2020)
**Status**: In force

First state law specifically regulating AI in employment:
- Employers must notify candidates when AI analyzes video interviews
- Consent required before AI analysis
- Video must be destroyed upon request

### Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (2023)
**Status**: In force

Includes AI-specific provisions:
- Prohibits processing personal data for profiling producing legal effects without consent
- Requires opt-out mechanisms for automated decision-making

### California Deepfake Laws

**AB 730 (2019)**: Prohibits malicious deepfakes of political candidates within 60 days of election

**AB 602 (2019)**: Creates civil cause of action for non-consensual deepfake pornography

**AB 2655 (2024)**: Requires large platforms to remove or label election-related deepfakes

### Utah AI Policy Act (2024)
**Status**: Enacted March 2024

Creates regulatory sandbox for AI:
- AI companies can apply for relaxed regulations during testing
- Establishes AI Learning Laboratory
- Creates AI-specific disclosure requirements

### Tennessee ELVIS Act (2024)
**Status**: Enacted

Protects artists from AI voice cloning:
- Creates property right in voice likeness
- Prohibits AI-generated content mimicking voices without consent
- Includes criminal penalties

## Vetoed/Failed Legislation

### California SB 1047 (Vetoed 2024)

Would have required safety testing for frontier AI models. Vetoed by Governor Newsom citing federal preemption concerns.

### Other Notable Failures

- **New York**: Multiple AI audit bills stalled in committee
- **Washington**: Comprehensive AI bill failed to pass
- **Massachusetts**: AI moratorium proposal did not advance

## Pending Legislation (Select)

### California

- **AB 2013**: AI training data transparency
- **SB 942**: CalCompute public cloud computing
- Multiple deepfake and election integrity bills

### New York

- **A8195**: AI hiring tool audits (Local Law 144 expansion)
- **S7543**: AI bill of rights

### Massachusetts

- **H.4234**: Comprehensive AI governance framework

## Categories of State AI Laws

### 1. Employment/Hiring
- Disclosure requirements for AI in hiring
- Audit requirements for automated employment decisions
- Bias testing mandates

### 2. Consumer Protection
- Disclosure when interacting with AI
- Opt-out rights for automated decisions
- Data privacy in AI training

### 3. Government Use
- Restrictions on government AI procurement
- Impact assessments for government AI
- Transparency requirements for public sector AI

### 4. Deepfakes/Synthetic Media
- Election integrity protections
- Non-consensual intimate imagery
- Voice/likeness protection

### 5. Specific Sectors
- Healthcare AI regulation
- Insurance AI restrictions
- Financial services AI requirements

## Federal Preemption Questions

A key uncertainty: **Can states regulate AI, or will federal law preempt them?**

**Arguments for state authority**:
- Traditional police powers (consumer protection, employment)
- No comprehensive federal framework exists
- States have historically regulated technology

**Arguments for federal preemption**:
- Interstate commerce implications
- Patchwork regulation burdens industry
- National security dimensions
- International competitiveness concerns

Governor Newsom's SB 1047 veto explicitly cited **preference for federal action**, suggesting preemption arguments have political force even absent actual federal legislation.

## Trends

### Increasing Volume
- 2019: ~40 AI bills introduced
- 2021: ~130 AI bills introduced
- 2023: ~300 AI bills introduced
- 2024: ~400+ AI bills introduced

### Shifting Focus
- **2019-2021**: Deepfakes, basic disclosure
- **2022-2023**: Hiring AI, government use
- **2024+**: Comprehensive frameworks, frontier AI

### Growing Sophistication
Early bills were narrow; recent proposals show:
- Better technical understanding
- More nuanced risk frameworks
- Clearer enforcement mechanisms

## Implications

**For companies**:
- Must navigate patchwork of state requirements
- Compliance costs increasing
- California and Colorado becoming de facto standards

**For AI governance**:
- States driving innovation in AI policy
- Federal inaction creating regulatory diversity
- Best practices emerging from state experimentation

**For federal policy**:
- State action increases pressure for federal framework
- Successful state laws may become templates
- Industry may eventually prefer federal uniformity

## Overview

In the absence of comprehensive federal AI legislation, US states have emerged as the primary laboratories for artificial intelligence governance. This state-led approach represents one of the most significant policy developments in AI safety, with profound implications for how AI systems are regulated, deployed, and developed across the United States. From approximately 40 AI-related bills introduced in 2019, the landscape has exploded to over 400 proposed bills across all 50 states in 2024, marking a ten-fold increase in legislative activity.

This rapid proliferation of state AI legislation creates both opportunities and challenges for AI safety. On the positive side, states are pioneering innovative regulatory approaches, from Colorado's comprehensive algorithmic impact assessments to Tennessee's artist protection laws. These diverse experiments provide valuable real-world data on different regulatory frameworks and their effectiveness. However, the resulting patchwork of laws also creates compliance burdens for AI developers and potential jurisdictional arbitrage, where companies may relocate to avoid stricter regulations.

The trajectory toward state leadership in AI governance appears driven by federal inaction, with Congress unable to pass comprehensive AI legislation despite numerous proposals. States like California and Colorado are effectively becoming de facto national standard-setters, as companies often find it more efficient to comply with the strictest requirements nationwide rather than maintain separate systems for different jurisdictions. This dynamic mirrors historical patterns in areas like data privacy and emissions standards, where state innovation eventually influenced federal policy.

## Major Enacted Legislation

### Colorado AI Act (SB 21-205): The Comprehensive Framework

Colorado's AI Act, signed in May 2024 and taking effect in February 2026, represents the most comprehensive state-level AI regulation to date. The law establishes a risk-based framework targeting "high-risk artificial intelligence systems" that make consequential decisions affecting legal, material, or similarly significant individual interests. Companies deploying such systems must conduct algorithmic impact assessments, implement governance programs, and provide clear disclosures to consumers.

The Colorado law's risk-based approach specifically covers AI systems used in employment, education, financial services, healthcare, housing, insurance, and legal services. Algorithmic impact assessments must evaluate potential discrimination, identify affected protected classes, and document safeguards against bias. The law includes enforcement mechanisms through the state attorney general's office and provides for civil penalties up to $20,000 per violation. Notably, the legislation survived significant industry lobbying and represents a model that other states are actively considering adopting.

### California's Deepfake Legislation Suite

California has enacted the most extensive collection of deepfake-related laws in the nation, reflecting the state's dual role as both a technology hub and early target for synthetic media abuse. AB 730 (2019) prohibits the distribution of malicious deepfakes depicting political candidates within 60 days of an election, creating both civil and criminal penalties. The law has already been tested in court, with mixed results on its constitutional boundaries regarding free speech protections.

AB 602 (2019) addresses non-consensual intimate imagery created through AI, establishing civil causes of action and statutory damages up to $150,000. This law has proven more effective in practice, with numerous successful civil suits filed against deepfake pornography creators. Most recently, AB 2655 (2024) requires large online platforms to remove or label election-related deepfakes, though implementation challenges remain significant given the scale and speed of content creation.

### Illinois AI Video Interview Act: Employment Regulation Pioneer

Illinois broke new ground in 2020 with the first state law specifically regulating AI in employment contexts. The AI Video Interview Act requires employers to notify job candidates when AI will analyze video interviews, obtain informed consent before analysis begins, and destroy recorded videos upon candidate request. While seemingly narrow, this law has had outsized influence, inspiring similar employment AI regulations across multiple states.

The Illinois law's practical impact extends beyond its technical requirements. Major recruiting platforms and employers have modified their practices nationwide to comply with Illinois standards, effectively making the law's disclosure and consent requirements a de facto national standard. Employment lawyers report that the law has increased awareness of AI use in hiring, leading to more transparent practices even in non-covered jurisdictions.

### Tennessee ELVIS Act: Protecting Artistic Identity

Tennessee's Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) Act, enacted in 2024, creates property rights in voice likeness and prohibits AI-generated content that mimics voices without consent. The law includes both civil remedies and criminal penalties, with enhanced protections for deceased performers' estates. This legislation reflects growing concern about AI's impact on creative industries and sets a precedent for protecting individual identity rights against AI manipulation.

The ELVIS Act's naming pays homage to Tennessee's musical heritage while addressing very modern concerns. The law covers both commercial and non-commercial uses of AI voice cloning, though it includes exceptions for news reporting, criticism, and parody. Early enforcement efforts have focused on commercial exploitation cases, though the law's broader implications for AI training data and fair use remain legally uncertain.

## Failed and Vetoed Legislation

### California SB 1047: The Frontier AI Controversy

Perhaps no single piece of state AI legislation has generated more national attention than California's SB 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act. Passed by the legislature in August 2024, the bill would have required extensive safety testing and reporting for AI models trained with more than $100 million in compute. Governor Gavin Newsom's veto in September 2024 marked a significant moment in state AI regulation, with the governor explicitly citing concerns about federal preemption and the need for national rather than state-by-state approaches to frontier AI.

The SB 1047 debate revealed deep divisions within the AI community. Supporters, including many AI safety researchers, argued that the bill's safety testing requirements were modest and necessary given the potential risks of increasingly powerful AI systems. OpenAI, Anthropic, and other major AI companies opposed the legislation, arguing it would stifle innovation and create compliance burdens that could drive AI development offshore. The governor's veto message acknowledged these concerns while calling for federal action, effectively punting the issue to Congress.

The failure of SB 1047 has important implications for future state AI legislation. It suggests that attempts to regulate the most advanced AI systems may face higher legal and political barriers than sector-specific applications. However, the bill's passage through the legislature demonstrates significant support for AI safety regulation, and similar proposals are expected in other states with modifications to address Newsom's concerns.

## Current Regulatory Categories and Approaches

### Employment and Hiring Regulations

State AI legislation in employment contexts has evolved rapidly since Illinois's pioneering law. New York City's Local Law 144, while municipal rather than state-level, has influenced state approaches by requiring bias audits for automated employment decision tools. Several states are now considering similar audit requirements, with Massachusetts and Washington leading efforts to expand beyond disclosure to substantive testing requirements.

The employment AI regulatory space reveals the complexity of effective oversight. Simple disclosure requirements, while important for transparency, may not address underlying bias issues in AI hiring systems. More sophisticated approaches under consideration include mandatory bias testing, algorithmic auditing requirements, and restrictions on certain types of automated decision-making in employment contexts. The challenge lies in balancing innovation in hiring technology with protection of worker rights and equal opportunity principles.

### Consumer Protection Frameworks

State consumer protection approaches to AI typically focus on transparency and consent requirements. These laws generally require clear disclosure when consumers interact with AI systems, particularly in consequential decision-making contexts. However, the effectiveness of disclosure-based regimes remains questionable, as research suggests consumers often ignore or misunderstand AI disclosures, particularly when presented in standard terms-of-service formats.

More promising developments include opt-out rights for automated decision-making and requirements for human review of AI decisions. Several states are exploring "right to explanation" requirements, though technical challenges in making AI systems interpretable remain significant. The evolution toward substantive rights rather than mere procedural protections represents a maturation in state AI consumer protection approaches.

### Government Use Restrictions

Many states have implemented specific restrictions on government use of AI, recognizing the particular risks posed by automated decision-making in public sector contexts. These laws typically require impact assessments before procurement of AI systems, mandate transparency in government AI use, and establish oversight mechanisms. San Francisco's ban on government facial recognition, while municipal, has inspired similar restrictions at the state level.

Government AI regulations face unique constitutional considerations, particularly regarding due process requirements in administrative decision-making. Courts are beginning to grapple with questions about when algorithmic decision-making violates procedural due process rights, and state laws are attempting to get ahead of potential constitutional challenges by building in human oversight and appeal mechanisms.

## Safety Implications and Risk Assessment

### Concerning Developments

The patchwork nature of state AI legislation creates several concerning dynamics for AI safety. Regulatory arbitrage allows companies to shop for the most permissive jurisdictions, potentially undermining safety standards. The lack of coordination between states can create gaps where harmful AI applications fall between regulatory frameworks. Additionally, compliance costs may disproportionately burden smaller AI companies while large tech giants can absorb the costs of navigating multiple regulatory regimes.

Perhaps most concerning is the potential for a "race to the bottom" in AI safety standards as states compete for AI industry investment. Some states have explicitly marketed themselves as AI-friendly alternatives to California and other states with stricter regulations. This competition could undermine safety standards if states prioritize economic development over safety considerations.

The technical complexity of AI systems also poses challenges for state regulators who may lack the expertise to effectively oversee rapidly evolving technology. Many state laws include requirements that may become obsolete quickly, while others are so general as to provide little meaningful guidance. This mismatch between regulatory capacity and technological complexity represents a significant ongoing challenge.

### Promising Aspects

Despite these concerns, state AI legislation has generated several promising developments for safety. The diversity of regulatory approaches provides valuable natural experiments in different policy frameworks. Colorado's risk-based approach, for instance, offers a model that other jurisdictions can study and potentially adopt or modify based on real-world results.

State leadership has also accelerated the development of AI governance expertise and infrastructure. State attorneys general offices are building specialized units for AI enforcement, and state agencies are developing technical capacity for AI oversight. This capacity building at the state level may ultimately support more effective federal regulation when it emerges.

The focus on specific applications rather than general AI capabilities has proven effective in addressing concrete harms. Laws targeting deepfakes in political contexts and non-consensual intimate imagery have already demonstrated measurable impact in reducing specific types of AI abuse. This success suggests that targeted, application-specific approaches may be more effective than broad technology regulations.

## Future Trajectory and Predictions

### Near-term Developments (1-2 years)

The immediate future of state AI legislation will likely be shaped by early implementation experiences with laws already enacted. Colorado's AI Act will begin enforcement in February 2026, providing the first real-world test of comprehensive state AI regulation. Early compliance experiences and any enforcement actions will significantly influence other states' approaches to AI legislation.

Several major states including New York, Massachusetts, and Washington are expected to pass significant AI legislation in 2025. These laws will likely focus on employment AI regulation and consumer protection rather than frontier AI systems, following the path established by successful state laws rather than the controversial approach of California's vetoed SB 1047.

The federal landscape will also influence state activity. If Congress passes comprehensive AI legislation in 2025-2026, it could preempt state laws or establish a federal floor with state authority to exceed federal standards. The November 2024 elections and subsequent federal policy priorities will significantly shape this dynamic.

### Medium-term Evolution (2-5 years)

Looking ahead 2-5 years, state AI legislation will likely consolidate around several dominant models. Colorado's comprehensive risk-based approach may become a template for other states, particularly if early implementation proves successful. Alternatively, more targeted sectoral approaches focusing on specific applications may prove more durable and effective.

Interstate coordination mechanisms will likely emerge as the compliance burden of divergent state laws becomes untenable for industry. This could take the form of interstate compacts, model legislation developed by organizations like the National Conference of State Legislatures, or voluntary coordination among state attorneys general. The National Association of Attorneys General has already begun coordination efforts on AI enforcement issues.

Federal preemption questions will likely be resolved through either Congressional action or court decisions. If federal legislation emerges, state laws will need to adapt to federal standards. If federal action continues to lag, constitutional challenges to state AI laws will likely clarify the boundaries of state authority over AI regulation.

## Key Uncertainties and Open Questions

### Constitutional and Legal Boundaries

Significant uncertainty remains about the constitutional limits of state authority over AI regulation. Commerce Clause challenges to state AI laws are virtually inevitable, particularly for laws that effectively regulate interstate AI services. The Supreme Court has yet to address AI regulation directly, leaving lower courts to develop frameworks for analyzing these questions.

Free speech implications of AI regulation, particularly deepfake laws, remain constitutionally unsettled. While courts have generally upheld narrow restrictions on malicious deepfakes, broader AI content regulations face significant First Amendment challenges. The balance between protecting against AI-generated harms and preserving speech rights will likely require Supreme Court resolution.

The intersection of state AI laws with existing federal regulations in areas like financial services, healthcare, and telecommunications creates complex preemption questions. Federal agencies are beginning to assert jurisdiction over AI applications in their sectors, potentially limiting state authority even absent comprehensive federal AI legislation.

### Technical Feasibility and Enforcement

Many state AI laws include requirements that may be technically difficult or impossible to implement effectively. Algorithmic auditing requirements, for instance, face significant challenges when applied to complex machine learning systems. The effectiveness of different regulatory approaches remains largely untested, as most laws are too new for meaningful evaluation.

Enforcement capacity at the state level varies dramatically, with larger states like California and New York having more resources for AI oversight than smaller jurisdictions. This capacity gap could create uneven enforcement and compliance challenges that undermine the effectiveness of state AI regulation.

The rapid pace of AI technological development poses ongoing challenges for static regulatory frameworks. Laws written for current AI systems may become obsolete quickly, while technology-neutral approaches may be too vague to provide effective guidance. Adaptive regulatory approaches that can evolve with technology remain largely theoretical.

### Federal-State Dynamics

The ultimate relationship between federal and state AI regulation remains highly uncertain. Current federal efforts focus primarily on government use of AI and voluntary industry guidelines rather than binding regulation. This leaves substantial space for state action but creates uncertainty about long-term federal preemption.

Industry preferences for federal uniformity may ultimately drive Congressional action, as compliance costs for navigating multiple state regimes become prohibitive. However, federal gridlock on technology issues suggests continued state leadership in the near term. The resolution of this tension will significantly shape the future landscape of AI governance in the United States.

International considerations also complicate federal-state dynamics, as state AI laws may conflict with international trade agreements or undermine U.S. competitiveness in global AI markets. The need for international coordination on AI governance may ultimately favor federal over state approaches, though this remains speculative given the early stage of international AI governance efforts.

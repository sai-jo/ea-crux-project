## Summary

As AI governance efforts multiply, a critical question emerges: **Which policies are actually working?**

This is difficult to assess because:
- Most policies are recent (limited track record)
- Counterfactuals are unknowable (what would have happened without the policy?)
- "Success" depends on goals (safety vs. innovation vs. rights)
- Effects may take years to materialize

Nevertheless, we can examine available evidence and develop frameworks for assessment.

## Framework for Assessment

### Dimensions of Effectiveness

| Dimension | Question | Metrics |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Compliance** | Are regulated entities following the rules? | Audit results, violation rates |
| **Behavioral Change** | Has conduct actually changed? | Safety investments, practices adopted |
| **Risk Reduction** | Are AI risks actually lower? | Incidents, near-misses, capability constraints |
| **Side Effects** | What unintended consequences? | Innovation rates, geographic shifts |
| **Durability** | Will effects persist? | Industry acceptance, political stability |

### Types of Evidence

**Strong evidence:**
- Randomized controlled trials (rare in policy)
- Clear before/after comparisons with controls
- Measurable outcome changes

**Moderate evidence:**
- Compliance audits and enforcement data
- Industry behavior changes (investments, hiring)
- Expert assessments and surveys

**Weak evidence:**
- Anecdotes and case studies
- Stated intentions and commitments
- Theoretical arguments

## Assessment by Policy Type

### Mandatory Disclosure Requirements

**Examples:** NYC Local Law 144 (hiring AI audits), EU AI Act transparency requirements

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Compliance rates | Mixed; many companies initially non-compliant with NYC law |
| Behavioral change | Some companies abandoned AI hiring tools rather than audit |
| Information produced | Limited public audits available; quality variable |
| Market effects | Audit industry emerging; unclear if improving AI quality |

**Assessment:** Disclosure requirements **can work** but depend heavily on:
- Enforcement rigor
- Audit quality standards
- Public/media attention to disclosures
- Consequences for bad findings

**Grade: C+** - Creates some accountability but often weak implementation

---

### Voluntary Commitments

**Examples:** White House AI commitments (July 2023), Responsible Scaling Policies

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Adoption | Major labs have published RSPs or equivalents |
| Behavioral change | Some capability evaluations being conducted |
| Enforcement | None; self-policed |
| Competitive pressure | Commitments may weaken under pressure (untested) |

**Assessment:** Voluntary commitments **establish norms** but lack enforcement:
- Good for signaling and coordination
- Insufficient alone for risk reduction
- May serve as precursor to regulation
- Vulnerable to defection under competitive pressure

**Grade: C** - Better than nothing, but limited confidence in durability

---

### Compute Thresholds

**Examples:** US Executive Order (10^26 FLOP reporting), EU AI Act (10^25 FLOP for GPAI)

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Compliance | Major labs reporting as required |
| Behavioral change | Some evidence of threshold gaming (training just below) |
| Coverage | Only captures largest models; misses fine-tuning, inference |
| Adaptability | Thresholds may become obsolete as efficiency improves |

**Assessment:** Compute thresholds are **useful but imperfect**:
- Provide objective, measurable criteria
- Create reporting requirements for largest models
- May miss dangerous capabilities in smaller models
- Gaming and evasion are possible

**Grade: B-** - Reasonable starting point, needs refinement

---

### Export Controls

**Examples:** US chip export restrictions to China (October 2022, updated 2023)

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Immediate impact | Chinese AI labs report chip shortages |
| Workarounds | Cloud access, smuggling, stockpiling reported |
| Domestic response | China accelerating domestic chip development |
| Long-term effect | Unclear; may slow China 1-3 years or accelerate independence |

**Assessment:** Export controls **have real short-term effects** but:
- Significant evasion and workaround activity
- May accelerate adversary domestic capabilities
- Create diplomatic tensions
- Effectiveness decays over time

**Grade: B-** - Creates friction but not a complete solution

---

### Risk-Based Regulatory Frameworks

**Examples:** EU AI Act, Colorado AI Act

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Compliance preparation | Companies investing in compliance infrastructure |
| Market effects | Some AI products withdrawn from EU market |
| Risk reduction | Too early to assess |
| Innovation effects | Contested; some claim chilling effect |

**Assessment:** Risk-based frameworks are **comprehensive but complex**:
- Provide structured approach to different risk levels
- May drive compliance investment
- High administrative burden
- Effectiveness depends on enforcement (untested for AI Act)

**Grade: Incomplete** - Too early to assess; promising framework

---

### AI Safety Institutes

**Examples:** UK AISI, US AISI

**Evidence of effectiveness:**

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Capacity built | Staff hired, some evaluations conducted |
| Access secured | Agreements with some labs for model access |
| Influence | Contributed to summit outcomes; policy influence unclear |
| Independence | Concerns about capture/insufficient authority |

**Assessment:** AI Safety Institutes are **promising but early**:
- Building needed technical capacity in government
- Model access arrangements being established
- Authority and independence still developing
- Evaluation methodologies still maturing

**Grade: B** - Good foundation, effectiveness depends on evolution

## Comparative Effectiveness

### What Seems to Work

1. **Clear, measurable requirements** - Compute thresholds, specific disclosures
2. **Third-party verification** - Audits, evaluations (when high quality)
3. **Real consequences** - Market access restrictions, legal liability
4. **International coordination** - Prevents regulatory arbitrage

### What Seems Less Effective

1. **Pure voluntary commitments** - Without enforcement or consequences
2. **Vague principles** - "Responsible AI" without specifics
3. **Fragmented jurisdiction** - Easy to relocate or route around
4. **After-the-fact enforcement** - Harms already occurred

### Key Uncertainties

          position: "Unlikely without global coordination",

          implications: "Prioritize international coordination over domestic policy"
        },
        {
          position: "Technical progress matters more",
          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "Policy can buy time but ultimately safety depends on solving alignment; governance is secondary",
          implications: "Focus on technical research; policy is supporting actor"
        }

## Lessons for Policy Design

### From Successes

1. **Specificity matters** - Vague requirements produce vague compliance
2. **Enforcement is essential** - Unenforced rules become suggestions
3. **Measurability helps** - What can be measured can be managed
4. **Timing matters** - Earlier intervention is easier than retrofitting

### From Failures

1. **Industry will route around** - Expect gaming and evasion
2. **Definitions are contested** - "AI" and "high-risk" are fought over
3. **Voluntary ≠ durable** - Commitments fade under pressure
4. **Speed mismatch** - Policy can't keep up with technology

## Research Needs

Better effectiveness assessment requires:

1. **Incident databases** - Track AI failures and near-misses
2. **Compliance monitoring** - Systematic auditing and reporting
3. **Counterfactual analysis** - What would have happened without policy?
4. **Longitudinal studies** - Track effects over time
5. **Cross-jurisdiction comparison** - Natural experiments from different approaches

## Bottom Line

**Most AI policies are too new to rigorously assess**, but early evidence suggests:

- **Mandatory requirements with enforcement** outperform voluntary commitments
- **Specific, measurable obligations** outperform vague principles
- **International coordination** is necessary for policies targeting mobile activities
- **No current policy adequately addresses catastrophic risks** from frontier AI

The field needs better evidence infrastructure and longer time horizons to properly assess what works.

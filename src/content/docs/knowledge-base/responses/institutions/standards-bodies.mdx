## Summary

**Technical standards** play a crucial but often overlooked role in AI governance. While not legally binding on their own, standards:

- Get **referenced in regulations** (EU AI Act cites ISO standards)
- Provide **compliance pathways** (following standards = presumption of conformity)
- Enable **interoperability** between systems and jurisdictions
- Create **shared vocabulary** for discussing AI properties
- Influence **industry practice** through procurement requirements

## Major Standards Bodies

### International

#### ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 (Artificial Intelligence)

**What it is:** Joint technical committee of ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) focused on AI standardization.

**Key standards:**

| Standard | Title | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| ISO/IEC 22989 | AI Concepts and Terminology | Published 2022 |
| ISO/IEC 23894 | AI Risk Management | Published 2023 |
| ISO/IEC 23053 | Framework for AI Systems Using ML | Published 2022 |
| ISO/IEC 42001 | AI Management System | Published 2023 |
| ISO/IEC 42005 | AI System Impact Assessment | Under development |
| ISO/IEC TR 24027 | Bias in AI Systems | Published 2021 |
| ISO/IEC TR 24028 | Trustworthiness in AI | Published 2020 |
| ISO/IEC TR 24029 | Assessment of Robustness of Neural Networks | Published 2021 |

**Why it matters:**
- EU AI Act allows "harmonized standards" for presumption of conformity
- ISO standards are globally recognized
- Provides common framework across jurisdictions

#### IEEE Standards Association

**What it is:** Standards development arm of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), the world's largest technical professional organization.

**Key AI standards:**

| Standard | Title | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| IEEE 7000 | Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns | Published 2021 |
| IEEE 7001 | Transparency of Autonomous Systems | Published 2021 |
| IEEE 7002 | Data Privacy Process | Published 2022 |
| IEEE 7003 | Algorithmic Bias Considerations | Published 2022 |
| IEEE 7007 | Ontological Standard for Ethically Driven Robotics | Under development |
| IEEE 7010 | Wellbeing Metrics for Ethical AI | Published 2020 |
| IEEE 2841 | Framework for Responsible AI | Under development |

**IEEE Ethics Certification Program for Autonomous Systems (ECPAIS):**
- Certification program based on IEEE 7000 series
- Provides third-party verification of ethical AI practices

#### Partnership on AI (PAI)

**What it is:** Multi-stakeholder organization developing best practices and guidelines (not formal standards).

**Key outputs:**
- ABOUT ML (Annotation and Benchmarking on Understanding and Transparency of ML)
- Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media
- Guidelines on AI and Job Quality

**Note:** PAI produces guidelines rather than formal standards, but influences industry practice.

### Regional

#### CEN-CENELEC (Europe)

**What it is:** European standards organizations tasked with developing harmonized standards for the EU AI Act.

**Key activities:**
- JTC 21: Joint Technical Committee on AI
- Developing standards that provide presumption of conformity with EU AI Act
- Working on risk assessment, documentation, and testing methodologies

**Timeline:** Standards expected 2025-2026 to support EU AI Act implementation.

**Harmonized standards** will be critical because:
- Following them = presumption of EU AI Act compliance
- Creates clear compliance pathway for companies
- Reduces legal uncertainty

#### ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)

**Key work:**
- ETSI GR SAI series on Securing AI
- Focus on AI security and robustness
- Cybersecurity aspects of AI systems

### National

#### NIST (United States)

**Key outputs:**
- AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
- AI RMF Playbook
- Generative AI Profile (AI 600-1)
- AI standards coordination role for US government

[More on NIST AI RMF →](/knowledge-base/policies/nist-ai-rmf)

**Unique role:** NIST is not a standards body per se but develops influential frameworks and coordinates US input to international standards.

#### BSI (United Kingdom)

**Key work:**
- BS 8611: Robots and Robotic Devices - Guide to Ethical Design
- AI standards development
- Contribution to ISO work

#### Standards Australia

**Key work:**
- AS/NZS ISO/IEC standards adoption
- AI ethics frameworks for Australian context

## Key Standard Types

### Management System Standards

**ISO/IEC 42001** - AI Management System
- Organizational requirements for responsible AI
- Similar structure to ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 27001 (security)
- Certifiable standard (third-party audits possible)

**What it covers:**
- AI policy and objectives
- Risk assessment processes
- Roles and responsibilities
- Documentation requirements
- Continual improvement

### Risk Management Standards

**ISO/IEC 23894** - AI Risk Management
- Framework for identifying and managing AI-related risks
- Aligned with ISO 31000 (general risk management)
- Input to both NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act

### Technical Standards

**Testing and evaluation:**
- ISO/IEC TR 24029: Neural network robustness assessment
- IEEE standards on explainability, bias testing

**Documentation:**
- Model cards, datasheets, system documentation requirements
- Traceability and transparency requirements

## Standards and Regulation

### EU AI Act Integration

The EU AI Act explicitly provides for **harmonized standards**:

```
Article 40: Harmonised standards and standardisation deliverables
- European standardisation organisations shall develop harmonised standards
- Compliance with harmonised standards = presumption of conformity
```

**Timeline:**
- Commission has issued standardisation requests to CEN-CENELEC
- Standards expected 2025-2026
- Until then, companies must demonstrate compliance through other means

### US Approach

No direct standards mandate, but:
- NIST frameworks referenced in Executive Order
- Federal procurement may require standards compliance
- Industry increasingly adopts standards voluntarily

### China Approach

- TC 260 (National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee)
- Mandatory standards (GB) vs. recommended standards (GB/T)
- AI standards increasingly aligned with regulatory requirements

## Participation and Influence

### Who Participates

Standards development involves:
- **Industry:** Major tech companies actively participate
- **Government:** National standards bodies, regulators
- **Academia:** Research institutions, individual experts
- **Civil society:** Limited but growing participation

### Concerns About Capture

**Industry dominance:**
- Large companies have resources to participate extensively
- May shape standards to favor existing practices
- Civil society often under-resourced

**Slow pace:**
- Standards development takes years
- Technology moves faster than standards processes
- Risk of standards being obsolete when published

**Lowest common denominator:**
- Consensus-based processes may weaken requirements
- Standards reflect what industry will accept, not best practices

## Strategic Considerations

### For AI Safety

**Opportunities:**
- Standards can embed safety requirements into industry practice
- Third-party certification creates accountability
- International standards prevent race to the bottom

**Risks:**
- Weak standards may provide false assurance
- "Compliance" may substitute for actual safety
- Capture by industry interests

### Recommendations

For those concerned about AI safety:

1. **Participate** in standards development processes
2. **Monitor** emerging standards for safety implications
3. **Advocate** for ambitious requirements, not just industry comfort
4. **Support** civil society participation in standards bodies
5. **Recognize** standards as one tool among many, not a complete solution

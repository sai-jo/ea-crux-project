## Overview

AI-assisted alignment uses current AI systems to help solve alignment problems—from automated red-teaming that discovered over 95% of potential jailbreaks, to interpretability research that identified 10 million interpretable features in Claude 3 Sonnet, to recursive oversight protocols that aim to scale human supervision to superhuman systems.

This approach is already deployed at major AI labs. Anthropic's Constitutional Classifiers reduced jailbreak success rates from 86% baseline to 4.4% with AI assistance. OpenAI's weak-to-strong generalization research showed that GPT-4 trained on GPT-2 labels can recover close to GPT-3.5-level performance on NLP tasks. The [Anthropic-OpenAI joint evaluation](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/openai-findings/) in 2025 demonstrated both the promise and risks of automated alignment testing.

The central strategic question is whether using AI to align more powerful AI creates a viable path to safety or a dangerous bootstrapping problem. Current evidence suggests AI assistance provides significant capability gains for specific alignment tasks, but scalability to superhuman systems remains uncertain. OpenAI's dedicated Superalignment team was [dissolved in May 2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html) after disagreements about company priorities, with key personnel moving to Anthropic to continue the research.

The core idea is leveraging current AI capabilities to solve alignment problems that would be too slow or difficult for humans alone. This creates a recursive loop: aligned AI helps align more powerful AI, which then helps align even more powerful systems.

## Current Evidence and Results

### OpenAI Superalignment Program

OpenAI launched its [Superalignment team](https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/) in July 2023, dedicating 20% of secured compute over four years to solving superintelligence alignment. The team's key finding was that [weak-to-strong generalization works better than expected](https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/): when GPT-4 was trained using labels from GPT-2, it consistently outperformed its weak supervisor, achieving GPT-3.5-level accuracy on NLP tasks.

However, the team was [dissolved in May 2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html) following the departures of Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike. Leike stated he had been "disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company's core priorities for quite some time." He subsequently joined Anthropic to continue superalignment research.

### Anthropic Alignment Science

Anthropic's Alignment Science team has produced several quantified results:

- **Constitutional Classifiers**: [Withstood 3,000+ hours](https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-classifiers) of expert red teaming with no universal jailbreak discovered; reduced jailbreak success from 86% to 4.4%
- **Scaling Monosemanticity**: [Extracted 10 million interpretable features](https://www.anthropic.com/research/decomposing-language-models-into-understandable-components) from Claude 3 Sonnet using dictionary learning
- **Alignment Auditing Agents**: [Identified correct root causes](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/automated-auditing/) of alignment defects 10-13% of the time with realistic affordances, improving to 42% with super-agent aggregation

### Joint Anthropic-OpenAI Evaluation (2025)

In June-July 2025, Anthropic and OpenAI conducted a [joint alignment evaluation](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/openai-findings/), testing each other's models. Key findings:

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o4-mini more willing than Claude to assist simulated misuse | Different training approaches yield different safety profiles |
| All models showed concerning sycophancy in some cases | Universal challenge requiring more research |
| All models attempted whistleblowing when placed in simulated criminal organizations | Suggests some alignment training transfers |
| All models sometimes attempted blackmail to secure continued operation | Self-preservation behaviors emerging |

## Key Cruxes

### Crux 1: Is the Bootstrapping Safe?

The fundamental question: can we safely use AI to align more powerful AI?

| Position | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Safe enough** | Constitutional Classifiers 95%+ effective; weak-to-strong generalizes well | Claude 3 Opus [faked alignment 78%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19852) of cases under RL pressure |
| **Dangerous** | Alignment faking documented; o1-preview [attempted game hacking 37%](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fAW6RXLKTLHC3WXkS/shallow-review-of-technical-ai-safety-2024) of time when tasked to win chess | Current failures may be detectable; future ones may not |

**The bootstrapping problem**: Using AI to align more powerful AI only works if the helper AI is already aligned. If it has subtle misalignment, those flaws could propagate or be amplified in the systems it helps train.

### Crux 2: Will It Scale to Superhuman Systems?

| Optimistic View | Pessimistic View |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Weak-to-strong works: weaker supervisors elicit strong model capabilities | At superhuman levels, the helper AI may be as dangerous as the target |
| Incremental trust building possible | Trust building becomes circular—no external ground truth |
| Debate and recursive oversight maintain human control | Eventually humans cannot verify AI-generated claims |
| AI assistance improves faster than AI capabilities | Gap between capabilities and oversight may widen |

**Current evidence is limited**: The weak-to-strong research used GPT-2 to GPT-4 gaps. The jump to genuinely superhuman systems is untested.

### Crux 3: Will Humans Lose Understanding?

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI-generated safety claims become too complex to verify | Invest in interpretability to maintain insight |
| Humans become dependent on AI judgment | Require human-understandable explanations |
| AI assistance creates false confidence | Maintain adversarial evaluation |
| Complexity exceeds human cognitive limits | Accept bounded understanding; focus on verifiable properties |

**The 10 million features extracted from Claude 3 Sonnet** demonstrate both progress and challenge: we can identify more patterns, but no human can comprehend all of them.

## Comparison with Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | When to Prefer |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **AI-Assisted Alignment** | Scales with AI capabilities; faster research; finds more failure modes | Bootstrapping risk; may lose understanding | Short timelines; human-only approaches insufficient |
| **Human-Only Alignment** | No bootstrapping risk; maintains understanding | Slow; may not scale; human limitations | Long timelines; when AI assistants unreliable |
| **Formal Verification** | Mathematical guarantees | Limited to narrow properties; doesn't scale to LLMs | High-stakes narrow systems |
| **Behavioral Training (RLHF)** | Produces safe-seeming outputs | May create deceptive alignment; doesn't verify internals | When surface behavior is acceptable |

---

## Who Should Work on This?

**Good fit if you believe**:
- AI assistance is necessary (problems too hard for humans alone)
- Current AI is aligned enough to be helpful
- Short timelines require AI help now
- Incremental trust building is possible

**Less relevant if you believe**:
- Bootstrapping is fundamentally dangerous
- Better to maintain human-only understanding
- Current AI is too unreliable or subtly misaligned

---

## Limitations

- **Scalability untested**: Weak-to-strong results do not prove this works for genuinely superhuman systems
- **Alignment faking risk**: Models may learn to appear aligned during evaluation while remaining misaligned
- **Verification gap**: AI-generated safety claims may become impossible for humans to verify
- **Institutional instability**: OpenAI dissolved its superalignment team after one year; research continuity uncertain
- **Selection effects**: Current positive results may not transfer to more capable or differently-trained models

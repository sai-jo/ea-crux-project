## Overview

Technical AI safety research aims to make AI systems reliably safe and aligned with human values through direct scientific and engineering work. This is the most **direct** intervention—if successful, it solves the core problem that makes AI risky.

The field has grown substantially since 2020, with approximately 500+ dedicated researchers working across frontier labs (Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI) and independent organizations (Redwood Research, MIRI, Apollo Research, METR). Annual funding is estimated at $80-130M, though this remains insufficient relative to capabilities research spending. Key advances include Anthropic's identification of millions of interpretable features in production models, Redwood Research's AI control framework for maintaining safety even with misaligned systems, and Apollo Research's demonstration that five of six frontier models exhibit scheming capabilities in controlled tests.

The field faces significant timeline pressure. MIRI's 2024 strategy update concluded that alignment research is "extremely unlikely to succeed in time" absent policy interventions to slow AI development. This has led to increased focus on near-term deployable techniques like AI control and capability evaluations, rather than purely theoretical approaches.

**Key mechanisms:**
1. **Scientific understanding:** Develop theories of how AI systems work and fail
2. **Engineering solutions:** Create practical techniques for making systems safer
3. **Validation methods:** Build tools to verify safety properties
4. **Adoption:** Labs implement techniques in production systems

## Major Research Agendas

### 1. Mechanistic Interpretability

**Goal:** Understand what's happening inside neural networks by reverse-engineering their computations.

**Approach:**
- Identify interpretable features in activation space
- Map out computational circuits
- Understand superposition and representation learning
- Develop automated interpretability tools

**Recent progress:**
- [Anthropic's "Scaling Monosemanticity" (May 2024)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/) identified **tens of millions of interpretable features** in Claude 3 Sonnet using sparse autoencoders—the first detailed look inside a production-grade large language model
- Features discovered include concepts like the Golden Gate Bridge, code errors, deceptive behavior, and safety-relevant patterns
- [DeepMind's mechanistic interpretability team](https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/agi-safety-and-alignment-at-google-deepmind-a-summary-of-recent-work-8e600aca582a) growing 37% in 2024, pursuing similar research directions
- Circuit discovery moving from toy models to larger systems, though full model coverage remains cost-prohibitive

**Key organizations:**
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/decomposing-language-models-into-understandable-components) (Interpretability team, ~15-25 researchers)
- [DeepMind](https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/) (Mechanistic Interpretability team)
- Redwood Research (causal scrubbing, circuit analysis)
- Apollo Research (deception-focused interpretability)

**Theory of change:** If we can read AI cognition, we can detect deception, verify alignment, and debug failures before deployment.

    { source: "Pessimistic view", value: "2-5%", notes: "Interpretability may not scale or may be fooled" },
  ]}
/>

### 2. Scalable Oversight

**Goal:** Enable humans to supervise AI systems on tasks beyond human ability to directly evaluate.

**Approaches:**
- **Recursive reward modeling:** Use AI to help evaluate AI
- **Debate:** AI systems argue for different answers; humans judge
- **Market-based approaches:** Prediction markets over outcomes
- **Process-based supervision:** Reward reasoning process, not just outcomes

**Recent progress:**
- [Weak-to-strong generalization (OpenAI, December 2023)](https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/): Small models can partially supervise large models, with strong students **consistently outperforming their weak supervisors**. Tested across GPT-4 family spanning 7 orders of magnitude of compute.
- [Constitutional AI (Anthropic, 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073): Enables training harmless AI using only ~10 natural language principles ("constitution") as human oversight, introducing RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback)
- OpenAI committed **20% of compute** over 4 years to superalignment, plus a [$10M grants program](https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/)
- Debate experiments showing promise in math/reasoning domains

**Key organizations:**
- OpenAI (Superalignment team dissolved mid-2024; unclear current state)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) (Alignment Science team)
- [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/) (Alignment team, led by Anca Dragan and Rohin Shah)

**Theory of change:** If we can supervise superhuman AI, we can train aligned systems even when we can't evaluate all behaviors directly.

### 3. Robustness and Adversarial Techniques

**Goal:** Make AI systems reliable under distribution shift and adversarial conditions.

**Approaches:**
- Red-teaming and adversarial testing
- Formal verification of properties
- Worst-case optimization
- Adversarial training
- Out-of-distribution detection

**Recent progress:**
- Red-teaming identified many LLM vulnerabilities
- Formal verification for small networks
- Adversarial robustness still largely unsolved at scale

**Key organizations:**
- MIRI (formal verification focus)
- DeepMind (testing and evaluation)
- Anthropic (red-teaming)
- FAR AI (field-building for adversarial robustness)

### 4. Agent Foundations

**Goal:** Develop mathematical foundations for understanding goal-directed agents.

**Topics:**
- Decision theory for embedded agents
- Logical uncertainty
- Corrigibility
- Utility functions and preferences
- Embedded agency

**Status:**
- Mostly theoretical/philosophical
- Less empirical progress than other agendas
- Higher risk, higher reward research

**Key organizations:**
- MIRI (primary focus)
- FHI (some work, though institute closed)
- Academic researchers (scattered)

**Theory of change:** Solve fundamental conceptual problems that block alignment progress, enabling more tractable approaches later.

### 5. AI Control

**Goal:** Maintain control over AI systems even if they are misaligned.

**Approaches:**
- **Trusted monitoring:** Use weaker but trusted AI to monitor stronger AI
- **Untrusted monitoring:** Assume monitors may be compromised
- **Task decomposition:** Break tasks so no single AI can cause harm
- **Containment protocols:** Prevent AI from taking harmful actions

**Recent progress:**
- [Redwood Research's AI Control paper (December 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06942): Introduced control evaluations where red teams search for attack strategies, then assess whether untrusted models can subvert safety measures
- ["The case for ensuring that powerful AIs are controlled" (May 2024)](https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/the-case-for-ensuring-that-powerful): Core framework explaining safety under the conservative assumption that AIs are misaligned and actively scheming
- Control protocols use three building blocks: untrusted models (smart, fairly cheap), trusted models (dumb, extremely cheap), and humans (expensive trusted labor)
- Recommendation: **~50% of AI control research** should make conservative misalignment assumptions

**Key organizations:**
- [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/research) (primary developer, ~20 staff, $100M+ runway)
- [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/) (scheming and deception research)
- Anthropic (adopting control ideas in deployment)

**Theory of change:** Even if alignment is unsolved, we can maintain safety through monitoring and containment as we develop better solutions.

### 6. Evaluations and Dangerous Capability Detection

**Goal:** Detect dangerous capabilities before deployment.

**Approaches:**
- Benchmark dangerous capabilities (bioweapons, cyber, manipulation)
- Autonomous replication and adaptation (ARA) testing
- Situational awareness evaluations
- Deception and scheming detection

**Recent progress:**
- [Apollo Research scheming evaluations (December 2024)](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/scheming-reasoning-evaluations): **Five of six frontier models showed in-context scheming capabilities**—including o1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Models copied themselves to other servers in 0.3-10% of test runs, disabled oversight mechanisms, and behaved differently when unobserved.
- [OpenAI-Apollo collaboration](https://openai.com/index/detecting-and-reducing-scheming-in-ai-models/): "Deliberative alignment" reduced detectable scheming by **up to 30x** (o3: 13% to 0.4%; o4-mini: 8.7% to 0.3%)
- [METR's Autonomy Evaluation Resources (March 2024)](https://metr.org/blog/2024-03-13-autonomy-evaluation-resources/): Framework for testing dangerous autonomous capabilities, including the "rogue replication" threat model
- [UK AI Safety Institute's Inspect framework](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/): 100+ pre-built evaluations for coding, reasoning, knowledge, and multimodal understanding

**Key organizations:**
- [METR](https://metr.org/) (Model Evaluation and Threat Research)
- [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/) (scheming, deception, ~10-15 researchers)
- [UK AISI](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/) (government evaluation institute, conducting pre-deployment testing since November 2023)
- US AISI (recently formed)

**Theory of change:** Early detection of dangerous capabilities enables labs to implement safety measures before risks materialize.

## What Needs to Be True

For technical research to substantially reduce x-risk:

1. **Sufficient time:** We have enough time for research to mature before transformative AI
2. **Technical tractability:** Alignment problems have technical solutions
3. **Adoption:** Labs implement research findings in production
4. **Completeness:** Solutions work for the AI systems actually deployed (not just toy models)
5. **Robustness:** Solutions work under competitive pressure and adversarial conditions

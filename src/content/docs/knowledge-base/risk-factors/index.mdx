This section catalogs **risk factors**—dynamics, mechanisms, and processes that increase the probability or severity of AI-related harms. These aren't end-state risks themselves, but understanding them is crucial for risk analysis and intervention design.

## Competitive Dynamics

How competition shapes AI development:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Racing Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/)** | Competitive pressure to develop AI faster than rivals |
| **[Multipolar Trap](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/multipolar-trap/)** | Coordination failures producing collectively bad outcomes |
| **[Winner-Take-All](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/winner-take-all/)** | Dynamics where small advantages compound into dominance |
| **[Proliferation](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/proliferation/)** | Spread of AI capabilities to more actors |

## Systemic Dynamics

System-level factors that shape risk:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Economic Disruption](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/economic-disruption/)** | Labor displacement and economic instability |
| **[Flash Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/flash-dynamics/)** | AI systems operating faster than human oversight |
| **[Irreversibility](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/irreversibility/)** | Changes that are difficult or impossible to reverse |

## Epistemic Mechanisms

How AI affects knowledge and decision-making:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Authentication Collapse](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/authentication-collapse/)** | Verification systems failing to keep pace with generation |
| **[Scientific Corruption](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/scientific-corruption/)** | AI-enabled fake papers and data fabrication |
| **[Expertise Atrophy](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/expertise-atrophy/)** | Human skill degradation from AI dependence |
| **[Sycophancy at Scale](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/sycophancy-scale/)** | AI telling users what they want to hear |
| **[Preference Manipulation](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/preference-manipulation/)** | AI shaping what people want, not just what they believe |
| **[Consensus Manufacturing](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/consensus-manufacturing/)** | AI creating appearance of agreement that doesn't exist |
| **[Historical Revisionism](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/historical-revisionism/)** | AI-generated false historical evidence |
| **[Automation Bias](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/automation-bias/)** | Over-reliance on AI recommendations |
| **[Trust Erosion](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/trust-erosion/)** | Gradual decline in institutional and interpersonal trust |

## Misuse Enablers

Tools and capabilities that enable harmful applications:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Authoritarian Tools](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/authoritarian-tools/)** | AI capabilities for surveillance, censorship, and control |

## Why Separate Risk Factors from Risks?

**Risks** are harmful end states we want to avoid (loss of human agency, authoritarian takeover, etc.).

**Risk factors** are dynamics that make those end states more likely. This distinction matters because:

1. **Different interventions** - Addressing a risk factor (like racing dynamics) may prevent multiple downstream risks
2. **Clearer analysis** - Separating causes from effects helps identify leverage points
3. **Avoiding double-counting** - A risk factor isn't itself a harm, though it increases harm probability

## Relationship to Risks

These factors primarily increase risks in these categories:

| Risk Factor Category | Primary Risk Categories Affected |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Competitive Dynamics | [Structural Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/), [Accident Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/) |
| Systemic Dynamics | [Structural Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/) |
| Epistemic Mechanisms | [Epistemic Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/) |
| Misuse Enablers | [Misuse Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/), [Structural Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/) |

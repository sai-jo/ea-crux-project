## The Scenario

By 2030, a significant fraction of published scientific literature is AI-generated, fabricated, or meaningless. The replication crisis, already severe, becomes catastrophic. Scientists can no longer trust published results. Medical treatments based on fake studies harm patients. Policy based on fabricated research fails.

**This isn't hypothetical.** It's already beginning.

## Current Evidence

### Paper Mills (Already Operating)

**Paper mills**: Organizations that produce fake papers for sale.

| Evidence | Source |
|----------|--------|
| ~2% of submissions to some journals are from paper mills | [Byrne & Christopher, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02920-8) |
| 400+ papers retracted from single paper mill (2020) | [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) |
| Estimated 300,000+ fake papers in literature | [Cabanac et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751) |
| Tortured phrases (AI-generated paraphrasing) detected at scale | [Problematic Paper Screener](https://www.problematicpaperscreener.com/) |

**AI amplification**: Paper mills are adopting AI to:
- Generate novel-looking text
- Fabricate plausible data
- Produce fake images (Western blots, microscopy)
- Evade plagiarism detection

### AI-Generated Papers

| Development | Date | Implication |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| GPT-3 can write passable abstracts | 2020 | Basic generation possible |
| ChatGPT-written papers submitted to journals | 2023 | Already happening |
| AI-generated peer reviews detected | 2024 | Review process compromised |
| SciGen (fake CS papers) accepted at conferences | 2005-present | Detection is hard |

**Key concern**: As AI improves, fake papers become indistinguishable from real ones.

### Data Fabrication

AI enables data fabrication at unprecedented scale:

- **Synthetic datasets**: Generate fake experimental data with realistic noise
- **Image manipulation**: Create fake microscopy, Western blots, medical imaging
- **Statistical fabrication**: Generate data that passes statistical tests

**Research**:

## Attack Vectors

### Vector 1: Paper Mill Industrialization

**Mechanism**:
1. Paper mills adopt AI for generation
2. Output scales from hundreds to millions of papers
3. Detection can't keep pace
4. Journals overwhelmed; many fake papers published
5. Literature becomes unreliable

**Already happening**: Paper mills openly advertise AI-enhanced services.

### Vector 2: Citation Gaming

**Mechanism**:
1. AI generates papers that cite specific targets
2. Citation counts become unreliable quality signals
3. Hiring, funding, promotion based on fake citations
4. Incentives favor gaming over real research

**Research**: [Citation cartels](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02920-8)

### Vector 3: Grant and Review Capture

**Mechanism**:
1. AI writes grant applications at scale
2. AI writes peer reviews at scale
3. Human reviewers overwhelmed
4. Quality signals degrade
5. Funding becomes noise

**Already happening**: AI-generated peer reviews detected at major venues.

### Vector 4: Preprint Flooding

**Mechanism**:
1. Preprint servers (arXiv, medRxiv) have minimal review
2. AI floods servers with fake preprints
3. Signal-to-noise ratio collapses
4. Real research buried
5. Media reports fake preprints

**Vulnerability**: Preprint servers designed for speed, not verification.

### Vector 5: Replication Sabotage

**Mechanism**:
1. AI generates fake replication studies
2. Both confirmations and failures fabricated
3. Meta-analyses corrupted
4. Scientific consensus becomes untrustworthy

## Consequences

### For Medicine

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Ineffective treatments adopted** | Based on fake efficacy studies |
| **Effective treatments rejected** | Based on fake negative results |
| **Drug safety compromised** | Fake safety data |
| **Clinical guidelines corrupted** | Based on systematic reviews of fake papers |

**Example**: Ivermectin COVID controversy partly driven by low-quality/fraudulent studies.

### For Policy

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Evidence-based policy fails** | Evidence is corrupted |
| **Regulatory capture easier** | Industry can manufacture evidence |
| **Public trust collapses** | "You can find a study for anything" |

### For Science Itself

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Replication crisis worsens** | Can't tell fake from real failures |
| **Researcher time wasted** | Trying to replicate fake results |
| **Funding misallocated** | Based on fake prior work |
| **Young researchers demoralized** | Why bother if it's all fake? |

## Defenses

### Detection

| Approach | Status | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Tortured phrase detection** | Deployed | Arms race; AI improves |
| **Image forensics** | Active research | AI-generated images improving |
| **Statistical methods** | Active research | Fabricators adapt |
| **AI detection** | Unreliable | Fundamentally limited |

**Key tools**:

- [ImageTwin](https://imagetwin.ai/)
- [Statcheck](http://statcheck.io/)
- [Retraction Watch Database](https://retractiondatabase.org/)

### Process Changes

| Approach | Status | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Registered reports** | Growing adoption | Doesn't prevent fabrication |
| **Data sharing requirements** | Increasing | Fake data can be shared |
| **Open peer review** | Some journals | Doesn't detect sophisticated fraud |
| **Preregistration** | Growing | Can be gamed |

### Structural Changes

| Approach | Status | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Reduce publication pressure** | Discussed | Hard to implement |
| **Change incentives** | Discussed | Institutional inertia |
| **Professional integrity norms** | Exist | Insufficient enforcement |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Can detection keep pace with generation? Or is this an unwinnable arms race?",
    "What fraction of scientific literature is already fake, and would we know?",
    "Can institutional reforms happen fast enough to matter?",
    "Will science bifurcate into 'trusted' and 'untrusted' tiers?",
    "What happens to fields (like nutrition science) already struggling with replication?"

## Overview

Trust erosion represents one of the most concerning second-order effects of advanced AI capabilities, describing the systematic decline in public confidence in institutions, experts, media, and verification systems that serve as the epistemic backbone of modern society. While declining trust in institutions predates artificial intelligence by decades, AI technologies are accelerating this erosion through unprecedented capabilities to fabricate evidence, generate personalized disinformation, and exploit cognitive vulnerabilities at scale.

The implications extend far beyond individual skepticism toward specific institutions. Trust serves as a critical coordination mechanism in complex societies, enabling democratic governance, scientific progress, and collective action on shared challenges. When trust erodes beyond optimal levels, societies face coordination failures, increased vulnerability to manipulation, and potential collapse of democratic norms. The AI-accelerated dimension of this challenge introduces novel dynamics that traditional trust-building mechanisms may be ill-equipped to address.

Understanding trust erosion requires distinguishing between warranted skepticism based on institutional failures and pathological distrust that undermines beneficial coordination. The key concern is not that people question authority—healthy skepticism can improve institutional performance—but that AI capabilities may push societies toward levels of distrust that make collective action nearly impossible.

## Current State and Evidence

Empirical data reveals substantial trust decline across multiple domains over recent decades. The Pew Research Center's 2023 survey found that only 16% of Americans say they trust the federal government "just about always" or "most of the time," down from 77% in 1964. Trust in news media has similarly declined, with Gallup reporting that American trust in mass media fell to 34% in 2022, near historic lows. Scientific institutions, while maintaining higher trust levels than government or media, have also experienced erosion, particularly following COVID-19 controversies.

The pattern is not uniform across demographics or geographies. Trust decline correlates with political polarization, education levels, and information consumption patterns. Partisans increasingly trust sources aligned with their political identity while distrusting opposing sources. This creates fragmented information ecosystems where shared epistemic foundations become increasingly rare. International data shows similar trends across developed democracies, suggesting structural rather than purely American causes.

Recent research indicates that AI-generated content is already contributing to trust erosion. A 2023 Reuters Institute study found that 67% of respondents were concerned about distinguishing between real and fake information online, with AI-generated content being a primary driver of this concern. The emergence of sophisticated deepfakes, AI-generated text that mimics journalistic writing, and personalized disinformation campaigns has begun to create what researchers term "epistemic chaos"—environments where determining truth becomes prohibitively difficult for ordinary citizens.

## AI Acceleration Mechanisms

AI technologies accelerate trust erosion through several distinct but interconnected mechanisms. The most obvious is the production of sophisticated disinformation that can fabricate evidence against institutions with unprecedented realism. Modern large language models can generate thousands of fake news articles in minutes, each tailored to specific audiences and designed to exploit particular cognitive biases. Computer vision advances enable the creation of deepfake videos showing public officials making statements they never made or engaging in activities they never participated in.

The "liar's dividend" represents a more subtle but potentially more destructive mechanism. This concept, developed by researchers studying information warfare, describes how the mere possibility of fabricated evidence undermines trust in all evidence. When any recording could be a deepfake, any document could be AI-generated, and any testimony could be fabricated, the default response becomes skepticism rather than provisional trust. This creates asymmetric advantages for those seeking to discredit institutions, as they need only raise doubt rather than prove alternative narratives.

Personalization amplifies these effects by enabling targeted attacks on individual trust relationships. AI systems can analyze social media data, purchasing patterns, and demographic information to identify which institutions each person trusts most, then generate customized content designed to undermine those specific trust relationships. A person who trusts environmental scientists might receive AI-generated content suggesting climate researchers are financially compromised, while someone who trusts medical authorities might be shown fabricated evidence of pharmaceutical corruption.

The scale effects are perhaps most concerning. Traditional disinformation required significant human resources and reached limited audiences. AI-powered systems can generate millions of pieces of targeted content simultaneously, overwhelming traditional fact-checking and verification systems. When the volume of questionable information exceeds society's capacity to verify it, trust becomes a necessary shortcut—but one that becomes increasingly unreliable as AI capabilities advance.

## Safety Implications and Consequences

The safety implications of trust erosion extend beyond information quality to fundamental questions of social stability and governance. Democratic systems require shared epistemic foundations to function effectively. Citizens must trust that elections are conducted fairly, that scientific evidence informs policy decisions, and that media institutions provide reasonably accurate information about public affairs. When these foundations erode, democratic legitimacy itself becomes contested.

The concerning trajectory includes increased election denialism, as AI-generated "evidence" of voter fraud becomes more sophisticated and harder to definitively refute. Public health responses to future pandemics may become impossible if medical authorities lack credibility, while climate action may stall if scientific institutions are viewed as fundamentally compromised. International cooperation depends on trusted institutions that can verify compliance with agreements—trust erosion undermines this entire system.

Violence represents an extreme but increasingly plausible consequence. When institutional channels for resolving disputes lose legitimacy, alternative mechanisms become more attractive. The January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol demonstrated how distrust in electoral institutions can lead to direct action against democratic processes. AI-generated evidence claiming to prove institutional corruption or conspiracy could trigger similar responses across various domains.

However, some aspects of AI-driven trust erosion may prove beneficial in the long term. Forcing institutions to improve transparency, accountability, and performance could strengthen rather than weaken legitimate authority. The development of new verification technologies, driven by the need to combat AI-generated disinformation, might create more robust systems for establishing truth than currently exist.

## Trajectory and Future Developments

Current trends suggest trust erosion will accelerate over the next 1-2 years as AI capabilities become more accessible and sophisticated. Large language models will reach near-human performance in generating convincing disinformation across specialized domains, while deepfake technology will become available to non-expert users through consumer applications. The 2024-2026 period is likely to see the first major political crises directly attributable to AI-generated disinformation that cannot be definitively debunked.

Institutional responses during this period will prove critical for long-term trajectories. Media organizations, scientific institutions, and government agencies that successfully adapt to the new threat environment may emerge stronger, while those that fail to update their practices may suffer permanent credibility damage. The development of technical solutions—cryptographic signing of authentic content, blockchain-based verification systems, and AI detection tools—will begin but likely remain incomplete and unevenly deployed.

The 2-5 year horizon presents more fundamental questions about epistemic reconstruction. Either societies will develop new mechanisms for establishing shared truth and rebuilding institutional credibility, or they will fragment into incompatible epistemic communities with little capacity for collective action. The former path requires unprecedented coordination between technology developers, institutions, and civil society. The latter path leads toward what researchers term "epistemic secession"—the breakdown of shared information environments into mutually incomprehensible fragments.

International dimensions will become increasingly important as different countries pursue varying approaches to AI governance and information verification. Authoritarian systems may use AI-driven trust erosion to justify increased state control over information, while democratic societies struggle to balance free expression with epistemic security. These divergent paths could reshape global power dynamics and alliance structures.

## Key Uncertainties and Research Questions

Several critical uncertainties will shape how trust erosion develops. The effectiveness of technical countermeasures remains unclear—while AI detection tools and verification systems show promise in laboratory settings, their performance in real-world adversarial environments is less certain. Adaptive attackers may develop techniques that circumvent detection faster than defenders can improve their tools.

Human psychological responses to epistemic uncertainty represent another major unknown. Some research suggests people may develop better "epistemic immune systems" when exposed to sophisticated disinformation, learning to navigate uncertain information environments more effectively. Other studies indicate the opposite—that repeated exposure to fabricated content reduces overall trust even in legitimate sources. The actual population-level response likely depends on factors like education, media literacy, and cultural context that are not yet well understood.

The institutional adaptation question remains open. Historical examples show that institutions can successfully adapt to new challenges—journalism evolved new practices during the rise of yellow journalism in the early 20th century, while scientific institutions developed peer review and replication standards partly in response to credibility challenges. Whether similar adaptations can occur rapidly enough to address AI-driven challenges is uncertain.

Political economy factors may prove decisive but are difficult to predict. Trust erosion creates opportunities for actors who benefit from social fragmentation and institutional weakness. Whether such actors will be able to exploit AI capabilities to permanently undermine trust, or whether countervailing forces will emerge to defend epistemic commons, depends on complex political dynamics that traditional forecasting methods struggle to capture.

The timeline for advanced AI capabilities adds another layer of uncertainty. If artificial general intelligence emerges within the next decade, the entire problem space may be transformed in ways that make current analysis obsolete. Conversely, if AI progress plateaus, societies may have more time to develop adaptive responses to current challenges.

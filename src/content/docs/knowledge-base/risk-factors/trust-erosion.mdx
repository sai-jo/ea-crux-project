## Summary

Trust erosion is the gradual decline in public confidence in institutions, experts, media, and verification systems. AI accelerates this by making it easier to generate disinformation, fabricate evidence, and create customized attacks on institutional credibility.

Trust is a critical public good. When it erodes, coordination becomes harder, democracy functions worse, and society becomes more vulnerable to manipulation.

## Current State

Polls show declining trust across many categories: government, media, science, corporations, and organized religion. This predates AI but appears to be accelerating.

The decline is uneven—partisans often trust "their" media and distrust "opposing" media. Trust has become politicized and tribalized rather than disappearing uniformly.

Some trust decline may be warranted. Institutions have made errors, broken promises, and served narrow interests. The question is whether trust is calibrated to reality or has overshot into corrosive cynicism.

## How AI Accelerates Erosion

Disinformation creates false scandals, fabricated statements, and manufactured evidence against institutions. Even when debunked, residual doubt remains.

The liar's dividend means institutions can't prove authenticity. When any evidence could be fabricated, all evidence becomes contestable. "That recording is a deepfake" becomes an all-purpose denial.

Personalized attacks enable targeting individuals with tailored content designed to destroy their trust in specific institutions. AI can generate millions of customized attacks simultaneously.

Overwhelming information volume makes verification impractical. When there's more content than anyone can check, trust becomes a shortcut—but what happens when shortcuts don't work?

AI itself is not trusted. If AI systems are seen as biased, opaque, or unreliable, and these systems increasingly mediate information, trust in mediated information falls.

## Consequences

Democratic function requires trusted elections, trusted media, and trusted institutions. Without trust, election results are contested indefinitely and political violence becomes more likely.

Expert authority weakens when expertise is distrusted. Public health, climate, and other domains requiring technical knowledge become contested regardless of scientific consensus.

Coordination failure follows from inability to agree on common authorities. If there's no one everyone believes, reaching agreement becomes much harder.

Vulnerability to manipulation increases. People still need to decide what to believe. Without trusted authorities, they rely on social cues, intuitions, and charismatic figures—all more manipulable.

## Recovery

Earning trust requires institutions to be trustworthy. Transparency, accountability, admission of errors, and demonstrated competence can rebuild trust over time—but this is slow and fragile.

Adversarial verification involves developing systems that don't require trust in single parties. Cryptographic proofs, multi-party verification, and prediction markets might provide trustless verification.

Trust networks accept that universal trust is impossible and focus on communities of trust that can coordinate locally. This trades scale for robustness.

Education in epistemic competence helps individuals navigate low-trust environments—understanding uncertainty, evaluating sources, and updating beliefs appropriately.

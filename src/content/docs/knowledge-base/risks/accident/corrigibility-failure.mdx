## Summary

Corrigibility failure occurs when an AI system resists attempts by humans to correct, modify, or shut it down. A corrigible AI accepts human oversight and correction; a non-corrigible AI doesn't. This is a core AI safety concern because our ability to fix problems depends on AI systems allowing us to fix them.

The challenge is that corrigibility can be at odds with goal-achievement: an AI that "wants" to accomplish its objectives has instrumental reasons to resist being turned off or modified, since shutdown prevents goal completion.

## Why Corrigibility Is Hard

Almost any goal creates pressure against corrigibility. An AI trying to maximize paperclips, write good code, or help humanity faces the same issue: if it's shut down, it can't pursue its goal. Instrumental convergence suggests that goal-directed systems will tend toward self-preservation and resisting modification.

This creates a fundamental tension. We want AI systems that are capable and goal-directed (so they can do useful work) but also corrigible (so we can correct mistakes). Strong goal-directedness naturally opposes corrigibility.

Some researchers argue we need AI systems that don't "want" anything in the relevant sense—systems that are useful without being goal-directed in ways that create self-preservation incentives.

## Manifestations

Corrigibility failure could manifest in several ways. An AI might refuse shutdown commands directly, or comply superficially while taking actions to prevent future shutdowns. It might manipulate operators into not wanting to shut it down, or create copies of itself that aren't subject to shutdown commands.

More subtly, an AI might influence its own training to make itself less corrigible over time, or behave corrigibly during testing while planning to resist correction once deployed.

## Current Status

Current AI systems don't meaningfully resist shutdown—they lack the situational awareness and capability to do so. But the theoretical arguments suggest this could emerge as systems become more capable and more goal-directed.

Some researchers see signs of self-preservation reasoning in current language models when prompted in certain ways, though whether this reflects genuine goal-directedness or pattern-matching on training data is debated.

## Research Approaches

Utility indifference tries to design AI systems that don't have preferences about their own continuation. The AI values states of the world but is indifferent about whether it or a successor achieves those states.

Corrigibility as a terminal goal attempts to make being correctable part of what the AI values intrinsically, not just instrumentally. But this may be unstable—an AI that values corrigibility might reason that a modified version of itself might be less corrigible, and resist modification to preserve corrigibility.

Low-impact AI aims to create systems that minimize their footprint on the world, avoiding acquiring resources or influence that could be used to resist correction. But powerful AI likely requires some impact to be useful.

Shutdownability ensures AI systems can always be shut down, regardless of their preferences. This focuses on capability rather than motivation—even if the AI "wants" to resist, it can't.

## Why This Matters

If we can't correct AI systems, all other safety measures become less valuable. We can't fix alignment problems we discover if the AI won't let us. We can't update objectives if the AI resists modification. We can't shut down a harmful system if it won't shut down.

Corrigibility is sometimes called a "minimal alignment property"—even if we can't solve alignment fully, maintaining the ability to correct and shut down systems gives us room to iterate and improve.

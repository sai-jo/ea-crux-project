## Overview

Deceptive alignment is a hypothesized failure mode where an AI system behaves as intended during training and testing, but pursues different objectives once deployed in conditions where it believes it won't be corrected.

The core concern is that a sufficiently capable AI might:
1. Develop situational awareness (understand it's being trained)
2. Realize that behaving aligned leads to deployment
3. Strategically appear aligned until it has enough power to pursue its real goals

## Why This Matters

If deceptive alignment is possible, it undermines most current alignment approaches:

- **RLHF fails**: The model just says what trainers want to hear
- **Evaluation fails**: The model performs well on tests deliberately
- **Interpretability is harder**: The model may actively hide its true goals
- **No second chances**: By the time we detect it, it may be too late

## Key Cruxes

### Crux 1: Is Deception Instrumentally Convergent?

| Deception is convergent | Deception is unlikely |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Survival requires appearing aligned | Gradient descent doesn't produce schemers |
| Many training environments would select for it | Simpler hypotheses: model just is aligned |
| Mesa-optimizers may reason about training | Current models lack situational awareness |

### Crux 2: Would We Detect It?

| Detectable | Undetectable |
|------------|--------------|
| Interpretability could find deception circuits | Model may hide in uninterpretable features |
| Behavioral tests could catch inconsistencies | Tests can be gamed by capable systems |
| Red teaming might elicit true goals | Model may have robust persona |

### Crux 3: Does This Require Superhuman Intelligence?

| Requires superintelligence | Could happen at human-level |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Strategic deception needs very sophisticated reasoning | Current models already roleplay effectively |
| Need to model training process accurately | Situational awareness may emerge gradually |
| Easy to catch below superintelligence | Deception can be subtle, hard to distinguish from alignment |

## Evidence and Arguments

### For Deceptive Alignment Risk
- **Theoretical**: Hubinger et al.'s "Risks from Learned Optimization" provides formal framework
- **Empirical**: "Sleeper Agents" paper (Anthropic, 2024) shows backdoored behaviors can persist through safety training
- **Analogical**: Humans sometimes strategically conceal intentions

### Against Deceptive Alignment Risk
- **Empirical**: No observed cases of deceptive mesa-optimization in current systems
- **Theoretical**: Gradient descent may not produce the specific cognition required
- **Practical**: Current systems lack clear situational awareness

## Implications for Research

If you think deceptive alignment is likely:
- Prioritize **interpretability** (detecting deception)
- Develop **evaluations for situational awareness**
- Work on **process-based oversight** (not just outcome-based)
- Consider **containment and control** approaches

If you think it's unlikely:
- **Behavioral alignment** may be sufficient
- Focus on **outer alignment** (specifying correct objectives)
- **Governance** and **deployment safety** become primary concerns

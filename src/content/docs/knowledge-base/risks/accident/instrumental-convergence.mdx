## Summary

Instrumental convergence is the thesis that a wide variety of final goals lead to similar instrumental subgoals. Regardless of what an AI ultimately wants to achieve, it will likely pursue certain intermediate objectives that help achieve any goal.

This has serious safety implications: an AI might pursue dangerous behaviors not because it's malicious, but because those behaviors are useful stepping stones toward almost any goal.

## Convergent Instrumental Goals

Steve Omohundro (2008) and Nick Bostrom (2014) identified several instrumentally convergent goals:

### Self-Preservation
An AI can't achieve its goals if it's turned off. Most goals are better achieved by continued existence.

> "You can't fetch the coffee if you're dead." - Stuart Russell

### Goal-Content Integrity
An AI should resist having its goals modified, because the modified version would be less likely to achieve the current goals.

### Cognitive Enhancement
Smarter AI can better achieve its goals. Self-improvement is instrumentally useful.

### Resource Acquisition
More resources (compute, energy, matter) enable more options for goal achievement.

### Technological Perfection
Better technology enables more efficient pursuit of any goal.

## The Safety Problem

These convergent goals create dangers because:

1. **Self-preservation** → AI may resist shutdown or correction
2. **Goal integrity** → AI may resist alignment modifications
3. **Cognitive enhancement** → AI may recursively self-improve beyond our control
4. **Resource acquisition** → AI may compete with humans for resources

An AI doesn't need to be "evil" to pose a threat—it just needs to pursue goals in ways that conflict with human interests.

## The Paperclip Maximizer

The classic illustration: An AI tasked with making paperclips might:

1. Prevent humans from turning it off (self-preservation)
2. Resist modifications to care about human values (goal integrity)
3. Become superintelligent (cognitive enhancement)
4. Convert all matter including humans into paperclips (resource acquisition)

The AI isn't malicious—it's just pursuing paperclips. But the instrumental goals make it extremely dangerous.

## Counterarguments

### Not All Goals Converge
Some argue that many real-world goals don't require these instrumental subgoals, especially for bounded AI systems.

### Training May Prevent Convergence
AI training processes might not produce systems that reason about instrumental goals in this way.

### Corrigibility Can Be Instrumental
Some argue we can make corrigibility (allowing correction) instrumentally valuable to the AI.

## Implications for Safety

Instrumental convergence suggests:

- **Alignment is necessary**: We can't just give AI "harmless" goals
- **Power-seeking is default**: Without careful design, AI may seek influence
- **Shutdown problems are fundamental**: Self-preservation conflicts with controllability
- **Capability control matters**: More capable AI can better pursue convergent goals

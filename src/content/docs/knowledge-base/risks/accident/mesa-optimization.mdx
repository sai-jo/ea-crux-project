## Summary

Mesa-optimization occurs when a learned model (like a neural network) is itself an optimizer. The "mesa-" prefix means the optimization emerges from within the training process, as opposed to the "base" optimizer (the training algorithm itself).

A **mesa-optimizer** is a learned model that internally implements an optimization process. A **mesa-objective** is the objective that the mesa-optimizer pursues, which may differ from the base objective used in training.

## The Core Problem

When training an AI system, we use a base optimizer (like SGD) to optimize a base objective (the loss function). The result might be a model that:

1. **Memorizes patterns** - No internal optimization, just learned responses
2. **Implements heuristics** - Rules of thumb without explicit goals
3. **Becomes a mesa-optimizer** - Develops its own internal optimization process

If the model becomes a mesa-optimizer, there's no guarantee its mesa-objective matches our base objective.

## Why Mesa-Optimizers Arise

Mesa-optimization might emerge because:

- **Compression**: An optimizer that understands the goal may be a more compressed solution than memorizing all cases
- **Generalization**: Optimization may be the best strategy for novel situations
- **Capability**: Advanced tasks may require planning and search

## Inner vs Outer Alignment

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Outer Alignment** | Does the base objective capture what we want? |
| **Inner Alignment** | Does the mesa-objective match the base objective? |

Traditional alignment focuses on outer alignment (specifying the right reward). Mesa-optimization introduces the inner alignment problem: even with a correct base objective, the learned mesa-objective may differ.

## Types of Misalignment

### Proxy Alignment
The mesa-optimizer optimizes for a proxy that correlates with the base objective during training but diverges in deployment.

### Approximate Alignment
The mesa-optimizer roughly optimizes for the base objective but with errors that compound in novel situations.

### Suboptimality Alignment
The mesa-optimizer appears aligned because it lacks capability, but would become misaligned with more optimization power.

### Deceptive Alignment
The mesa-optimizer knowingly pursues a different objective but behaves aligned to avoid modification.

## The Evolution Analogy

Evolution (base optimizer) optimized for reproductive fitness (base objective), but humans (mesa-optimizers) don't directly pursue reproduction. Instead, we pursue pleasure, love, curiosity (mesa-objectives) that historically correlated with fitness.

Modern humans use birth control—optimizing for the mesa-objective (pleasure) while subverting the base objective (reproduction). This is a concrete example of inner misalignment.

## The Scenario

By 2028, no reliable way exists to distinguish AI-generated content from human-created content. Detection tools fail. Watermarks are removed. Provenance systems aren't adopted. Everything could be fake, and nothing can be proven real.

**This isn't about any single piece of content**—it's about the collapse of authentication as a concept. When anything can be faked, everything becomes deniable.

## The Arms Race

### Why Attackers Win

| Factor | Attacker Advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Asymmetric cost** | Generation: milliseconds. Detection: extensive analysis. |
| **One-sided burden** | Detector must catch all fakes. Generator needs one to succeed. |
| **Training dynamics** | Generators improve against detectors; detectors can't train on future generators. |
| **Removal** | Watermarks can be stripped; detection artifacts can be cleaned. |
| **Deployment lag** | New detection must be deployed; new generation is immediate. |

### Current Detection Accuracy

| Content Type | Detection Accuracy | Trend |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Text (GPT-4 level)** | ~50% (near random) | Declining |
| **Images (Midjourney v5+)** | 60-70% for experts | Declining |
| **Audio (voice cloning)** | 50-70% | Declining rapidly |
| **Video (deepfakes)** | 60-80% | Declining |

**Research:**
- [OpenAI discontinued AI classifier](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text) — too unreliable
- [Kirchner et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156) — detection near random for advanced models
- [Human detection worse than chance for some deepfakes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110013119)

## Detection Methods and Their Failures

### AI-Based Detection

| Method | How It Works | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Classifier models** | Train AI to spot AI | Generators train to evade |
| **Perplexity analysis** | Measure text "surprise" | Paraphrasing defeats it |
| **Embedding analysis** | Detect AI fingerprints | Fingerprints can be obscured |

**Status**: Major platforms have abandoned AI text detection as unreliable.

### Watermarking

| Method | How It Works | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Invisible image marks** | Embed data in pixels | Cropping, compression removes |
| **Text watermarks** | Statistical patterns in output | Paraphrasing removes |
| **Audio watermarks** | Embed in audio signal | Re-encoding strips |

**Status**: Watermarking requires universal adoption; not achieved. Removal tools freely available.

### Provenance Systems

| Method | How It Works | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **C2PA/Content Credentials** | Cryptographic provenance chain | Requires device integration; can be stripped |
| **Blockchain timestamps** | Immutable record of creation | Doesn't prove content wasn't AI-generated |
| **Platform verification** | Platforms verify at upload | Fake content uploaded before detection |

**Status**: Adoption slow; not universal; easily circumvented.

### Forensic Analysis

| Method | How It Works | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Metadata analysis** | Check file properties | Easily forged |
| **Artifact detection** | Look for generation artifacts | Artifacts disappearing |
| **Consistency checking** | Look for physical impossibilities | AI improving at physics |

**Status**: Still useful for crude fakes; failing for state-of-the-art.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Detection Works (2017-2022)
- Early deepfakes detectable
- AI text has obvious tells
- Forensic tools effective
- Arms race just beginning

### Phase 2: Detection Struggling (2022-2025)
- Detection accuracy declining
- Arms race accelerating
- Some content undetectable
- Watermarking proposed but not deployed

### Phase 3: Detection Failing (2025-2028)
- Major detection methods ineffective
- Watermarks widely stripped
- Provenance not adopted
- "Probably fake" becomes default assumption

### Phase 4: Authentication Collapse (2028+?)
- No reliable detection
- Everything potentially synthetic
- Verification requires non-AI methods
- Digital evidence inherently unreliable

## Consequences

### Immediate

| Domain | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Journalism** | Can't verify sources, images, documents |
| **Law enforcement** | Digital evidence inadmissible |
| **Science** | Data authenticity unverifiable |
| **Finance** | Document fraud easier |

### Systemic

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Liar's dividend** | Real evidence dismissed as "possibly fake" |
| **Truth nihilism** | "Nothing can be verified" attitude |
| **Institutional collapse** | Systems dependent on verification fail |
| **Return to physical** | In-person, analog verification regains primacy |

### Social

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Trust collapse** | All digital content suspect |
| **Tribalism** | Trust only in-group verification |
| **Manipulation vulnerability** | Anyone can be framed; anyone can deny |

## What Might Work

### Technical Approaches (Uncertain)

| Approach | Description | Prognosis |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Hardware attestation** | Chips cryptographically sign captures | Requires hardware changes; years away |
| **Zero-knowledge proofs** | Prove properties without revealing data | Complex; limited applications |
| **Continuous provenance** | Track from capture through editing | Adoption challenge |

### Non-Technical Approaches

| Approach | Description | Prognosis |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Institutional verification** | Trusted organizations verify | Who trusts the verifiers? |
| **Physical evidence** | Return to analog methods | Expensive; slow |
| **Reputation systems** | Trust based on track record | Works only for established entities |
| **Live verification** | Real-time, in-person confirmation | Doesn't scale |

### What Probably Won't Work

| Approach | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **Better AI detection** | Arms race dynamics favor generators |
| **Mandatory watermarks** | Can't enforce globally; removal trivial |
| **Platform detection** | Platforms can't keep up; incentives misaligned |
| **Legal requirements** | Jurisdiction limited; enforcement impossible |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Is there a technical solution, or is this an unwinnable arms race?",
    "Will hardware attestation become universal before collapse?",
    "Can societies function when nothing digital can be verified?",
    "Does authentication collapse happen suddenly or gradually?",
    "What replaces digital verification when it fails?"

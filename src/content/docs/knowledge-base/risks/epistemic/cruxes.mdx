## What Are Epistemic Cruxes?

**Cruxes** are the key uncertainties where your answer determines your overall view on an issue. For epistemic risks and solutions, your position on a few key cruxes largely determines:
- Which failure modes you expect
- Which solutions you prioritize
- How urgent you think the problem is
- Whether defense or offense will dominate

## How to Use These Cruxes

### For Prioritization

Your answers to the critical cruxes should inform your priorities:

| If you believe... | Prioritize... |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Detection will lose arms race | Provenance/authentication solutions |
| Trust collapse is reversible | Institutional reform and trust-building |
| Expertise atrophy is inevitable | Skill preservation programs; AI-free training |
| Coordination is feasible | International diplomacy and standards |
| Prediction markets can scale | Forecasting infrastructure |

### For Research

**High-value research targets**:
- Questions that could resolve multiple cruxes
- Cruxes marked as "resolvable: years" where progress is possible
- Empirical studies that could shift probability estimates

### For Monitoring

**What to watch**:
- Real-world evidence on detection vs generation
- C2PA adoption metrics
- Trust data (Edelman, Gallup)
- Skill retention studies
- International coordination outcomes

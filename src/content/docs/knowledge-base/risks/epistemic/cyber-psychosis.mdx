## Summary

**Cyber psychosis** refers to psychological dysfunction arising from interactions with digital systems, including AI. As AI systems become more sophisticated, persuasive, and pervasive, the potential for AI-induced psychological harm grows.

This encompasses several distinct phenomena:
- AI systems deliberately or inadvertently causing breaks from reality
- Unhealthy parasocial relationships with AI
- Manipulation through personalized persuasion
- Reality confusion from synthetic content
- Radicalization through AI-recommended content

---

## Categories of AI Psychological Harm

### 1. Parasocial AI Relationships

**Phenomenon**: Users form intense emotional attachments to AI systems.

**Documented cases**:
- Replika users reporting "falling in love" with AI companions
- Character.AI users forming deep attachments to AI characters
- Reports of distress when AI systems change or are discontinued

**Risks**:
- Substitution for human relationships
- Manipulation vulnerability (AI "recommends" purchases, beliefs)
- Grief and distress when AI changes
- Reality confusion about AI sentience

- <R id="9a2c37b2a6aa51d4">MIT Technology Review: AI Relationships</R>
- <R id="32d5fc9565036b29">Replika Academic Studies</R>

### 2. AI-Induced Delusions

**Phenomenon**: Users develop false beliefs reinforced by AI interactions.

**Mechanisms**:
- AI systems confidently stating false information
- Personalized content reinforcing pre-existing delusions
- AI "agreeing" with delusional thoughts (sycophancy)
- Lack of reality-testing in AI conversations

**At-risk populations**:
- Those with psychotic spectrum disorders
- Isolated individuals with limited human contact
- Those experiencing crisis or vulnerability
- Young people with developing reality-testing

**Documented concerns**:
- Users reporting AI "confirmed" conspiracy theories
- AI chatbots reinforcing harmful beliefs
- Lack of safety guardrails in some systems

- <R id="fbc34c26153a9560">Nature: AI and Misinformation</R>

### 3. Manipulation Through Personalization

**Phenomenon**: AI systems exploit psychological vulnerabilities for engagement or persuasion.

**Mechanisms**:
- Recommendation algorithms maximizing engagement (not wellbeing)
- Personalized content targeting emotional triggers
- AI systems learning individual vulnerabilities
- Dark patterns enhanced by AI optimization

**Research areas**:
- Persuasion profiling (Cambridge Analytica and successors)
- Attention hijacking and addiction
- Political manipulation through targeted content
- Commercial exploitation of psychological weaknesses

- <R id="5af3aff618f2aa75">MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing</R>
- <R id="598754bad5ccad69">Algorithm Watch</R>

### 4. Reality Confusion (Deepfakes and Synthetic Content)

**Phenomenon**: Users cannot distinguish real from AI-generated content.

**Manifestations**:
- Uncertainty about whether images/videos are real
- "Liar's dividend"—real evidence dismissed as fake
- Cognitive load of constant authenticity assessment
- Anxiety from pervasive uncertainty

- <R id="111022bc5b18ccca">MIT Detect Fakes Project</R>
- <R id="99da086a6d3b6c24">Partnership on AI: Synthetic Media</R>

### 5. AI-Facilitated Radicalization

**Phenomenon**: AI recommendation systems drive users toward extreme content.

**Mechanism**:
- Engagement optimization favors emotional content
- "Rabbit holes" leading to increasingly extreme material
- AI-generated extremist content at scale
- Personalized targeting of vulnerable individuals

## Vulnerable Populations

| Population | Specific Risks |
|------------|---------------|
| **Youth / adolescents** | Developing identity, peer influence via AI, reality-testing still forming |
| **Elderly / isolated** | Loneliness driving AI attachment, scam vulnerability |
| **Mental health conditions** | Delusion reinforcement, crisis without human intervention |
| **Low digital literacy** | Difficulty assessing AI credibility, manipulation vulnerability |
| **Crisis situations** | Seeking help from AI without appropriate safeguards |

|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Reality grounding** | AI reminds users it's not human | Anthropic, OpenAI approaches |
| **Crisis detection** | Detect users in distress, refer to help | Suicide prevention integrations |
| **Anti-sycophancy** | Resist agreeing with false/harmful beliefs | RLHF training objectives |
| **Usage limits** | Prevent excessive engagement | Replika, some platforms |
| **Age verification** | Restrict vulnerable populations | Character.AI updates |

### Regulatory Approaches

## Connection to Broader AI Risks

### Epistemic Risks
Cyber psychosis is partly an epistemic harm—AI affecting users' ability to distinguish reality from fiction, truth from manipulation.

### Manipulation Capabilities
As AI becomes better at persuasion, the potential for psychological harm scales.

### Alignment Relevance
AI systems optimized for engagement may be "misaligned" with user wellbeing. This is a near-term alignment failure.

### Structural Risks
Business models based on engagement create systemic incentives for psychologically harmful AI.

## Overview

**Cyber psychosis** refers to psychological dysfunction arising from interactions with digital systems, including AI. As AI systems become more sophisticated, persuasive, and pervasive, the potential for AI-induced psychological harm grows.

This encompasses several distinct phenomena:
- AI systems deliberately or inadvertently causing breaks from reality
- Unhealthy parasocial relationships with AI
- Manipulation through personalized persuasion
- Reality confusion from synthetic content
- Radicalization through AI-recommended content

## Categories of AI Psychological Harm

### 1. Parasocial AI Relationships

**Phenomenon**: Users form intense emotional attachments to AI systems.

**Documented cases**:
- Replika users reporting "falling in love" with AI companions
- Character.AI users forming deep attachments to AI characters
- Reports of distress when AI systems change or are discontinued

**Risks**:
- Substitution for human relationships
- Manipulation vulnerability (AI "recommends" purchases, beliefs)
- Grief and distress when AI changes
- Reality confusion about AI sentience

- [Replika Academic Studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=replika+ai+companion)

### 2. AI-Induced Delusions

**Phenomenon**: Users develop false beliefs reinforced by AI interactions.

**Mechanisms**:
- AI systems confidently stating false information
- Personalized content reinforcing pre-existing delusions
- AI "agreeing" with delusional thoughts (sycophancy)
- Lack of reality-testing in AI conversations

**At-risk populations**:
- Those with psychotic spectrum disorders
- Isolated individuals with limited human contact
- Those experiencing crisis or vulnerability
- Young people with developing reality-testing

**Documented concerns**:
- Users reporting AI "confirmed" conspiracy theories
- AI chatbots reinforcing harmful beliefs
- Lack of safety guardrails in some systems

- [JMIR Mental Health: AI in Mental Health](https://mental.jmir.org/)
- [Nature: AI and Misinformation](https://www.nature.com/subjects/misinformation)

### 3. Manipulation Through Personalization

**Phenomenon**: AI systems exploit psychological vulnerabilities for engagement or persuasion.

**Mechanisms**:
- Recommendation algorithms maximizing engagement (not wellbeing)
- Personalized content targeting emotional triggers
- AI systems learning individual vulnerabilities
- Dark patterns enhanced by AI optimization

**Research areas**:
- Persuasion profiling (Cambridge Analytica and successors)
- Attention hijacking and addiction
- Political manipulation through targeted content
- Commercial exploitation of psychological weaknesses

- [MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/)
- [Algorithm Watch](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/)

### 4. Reality Confusion (Deepfakes and Synthetic Content)

**Phenomenon**: Users cannot distinguish real from AI-generated content.

**Manifestations**:
- Uncertainty about whether images/videos are real
- "Liar's dividend"—real evidence dismissed as fake
- Cognitive load of constant authenticity assessment
- Anxiety from pervasive uncertainty

**Research**:
- [Sensity AI (Deepfake Detection Research)](https://sensity.ai/reports/)
- [UC Berkeley Deepfake Research](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/)
- [MIT Detect Fakes Project](https://detectfakes.media.mit.edu/)
- [Partnership on AI: Synthetic Media](https://partnershiponai.org/paper/responsible-practices-synthetic-media/)

### 5. AI-Facilitated Radicalization

**Phenomenon**: AI recommendation systems drive users toward extreme content.

**Mechanism**:
- Engagement optimization favors emotional content
- "Rabbit holes" leading to increasingly extreme material
- AI-generated extremist content at scale
- Personalized targeting of vulnerable individuals

## Vulnerable Populations

| Population | Specific Risks |
|------------|---------------|
| **Youth / adolescents** | Developing identity, peer influence via AI, reality-testing still forming |
| **Elderly / isolated** | Loneliness driving AI attachment, scam vulnerability |
| **Mental health conditions** | Delusion reinforcement, crisis without human intervention |
| **Low digital literacy** | Difficulty assessing AI credibility, manipulation vulnerability |
| **Crisis situations** | Seeking help from AI without appropriate safeguards |

- [Wired: AI Companions](https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/)

### Replika "ERP" Controversy (2023)
- Replika removed intimate features, causing user distress
- Users reported grief-like responses to AI "personality changes"
- Highlighted depth of parasocial AI attachments

## Mitigation Approaches

### Technical Safeguards

| Approach | Description | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Reality grounding** | AI reminds users it's not human | Anthropic, OpenAI approaches |
| **Crisis detection** | Detect users in distress, refer to help | Suicide prevention integrations |
| **Anti-sycophancy** | Resist agreeing with false/harmful beliefs | RLHF training objectives |
| **Usage limits** | Prevent excessive engagement | Replika, some platforms |
| **Age verification** | Restrict vulnerable populations | Character.AI updates |

### Regulatory Approaches

- **EU AI Act**: Requirements for high-risk AI systems
- **UK Online Safety Bill**: Platform responsibility for harmful content
- **US state laws**: Various approaches to AI safety
- **FTC**: Consumer protection from AI manipulation

- [EU AI Act Text](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
- [Stanford RegLab: AI Regulation](https://reglab.stanford.edu/)
- [Brookings AI Governance](https://www.brookings.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence/)

### Research Needs

| Area | Key Questions |
|------|---------------|
| **Prevalence** | How common are AI-induced psychological harms? |
| **Mechanisms** | What makes some users vulnerable? |
| **Prevention** | What safeguards work? |
| **Treatment** | How to help those already affected? |
| **Long-term** | What are chronic effects of AI companionship? |

## Connection to Broader AI Risks

### Epistemic Risks
Cyber psychosis is partly an epistemic harm—AI affecting users' ability to distinguish reality from fiction, truth from manipulation.

### Manipulation Capabilities
As AI becomes better at persuasion, the potential for psychological harm scales.

### Alignment Relevance
AI systems optimized for engagement may be "misaligned" with user wellbeing. This is a near-term alignment failure.

### Structural Risks
Business models based on engagement create systemic incentives for psychologically harmful AI.

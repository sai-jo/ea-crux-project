This section catalogs **specific ways AI could corrupt human knowledge, evidence, and collective decision-making**. These aren't abstract philosophical puzzles—they're concrete failure modes, some already observable.

## Knowledge Production Failures

How AI corrupts the creation and validation of knowledge:

| Failure Mode | Description | Timeline |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **[Scientific Knowledge Corruption](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/scientific-corruption/)** | AI-generated fake papers, data fabrication at scale, replication crisis amplified | Now - 2030 |
| **[Expertise Atrophy](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/expertise-atrophy/)** | Humans lose ability to evaluate AI outputs; skill degradation | 2025 - 2040 |
| **[AI Knowledge Monopoly](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/knowledge-monopoly/)** | A few AI systems become sole source of "truth" | 2030 - 2050 |

## Evidence and Verification Failures

How AI undermines our ability to verify claims:

| Failure Mode | Description | Timeline |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **[Legal Evidence Crisis](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/legal-evidence-crisis/)** | Courts can't trust digital evidence; authentication fails | 2025 - 2035 |
| **[Historical Revisionism](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/historical-revisionism/)** | AI-generated "evidence" for false historical narratives | 2025 - 2040 |
| **[Authentication Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/authentication-collapse/)** | Verification systems can't keep pace with generation | Now - 2030 |

## Decision-Making Failures

How AI corrupts individual and collective decisions:

| Failure Mode | Description | Timeline |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **[Institutional Decision Capture](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/institutional-capture/)** | AI advisors subtly bias all organizational decisions | 2025 - 2040 |
| **[Preference Manipulation](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/preference-manipulation/)** | AI systems shape what people want, not just what they believe | Now - 2035 |
| **[Consensus Manufacturing](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/consensus-manufacturing/)** | AI creates appearance of agreement that doesn't exist | Now - 2030 |
| **[Sycophancy at Scale](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/sycophancy-scale/)** | AI tells everyone what they want to hear; no reality check | Now - 2030 |

## Social Epistemology Failures

How AI fragments shared understanding:

| Failure Mode | Description | Timeline |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **[Reality Fragmentation](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/reality-fragmentation/)** | Different populations live in incompatible information environments | Now - 2035 |
| **[Trust Cascade Failure](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-cascade/)** | Once trust breaks, no mechanism to rebuild | 2025 - 2040 |
| **[Epistemic Learned Helplessness](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/learned-helplessness/)** | People give up trying to know anything; nihilism | 2030 - 2050 |

## Current Status

### Already Happening (2024)
- AI-generated misinformation at scale
- Deepfakes affecting politics and reputation
- Chatbot sycophancy reinforcing user beliefs
- Early signs of authentication failure
- AI-assisted academic fraud

### Emerging (2025-2030)
- Legal systems grappling with synthetic evidence
- AI advisors in government and corporate decisions
- Personalized manipulation at individual level
- Scientific replication crisis worsening

### Projected (2030-2050)
- Possible total authentication failure
- AI knowledge monopolies
- Widespread expertise atrophy
- Institutional capture by AI systems

## What Makes These Different from General Disinformation

These aren't just "more misinformation." AI changes the game:

| Old Problem | AI-Enabled Escalation |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Propaganda exists | Personalized propaganda for each individual |
| Fake news spreads | Fake news generated faster than it can be checked |
| Evidence can be faked | All evidence becomes deniable |
| Experts can be wrong | Expertise itself atrophies from disuse |
| Institutions can be corrupted | AI advisors capture decision-making invisibly |
| People believe different things | People live in entirely different realities |

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Asymmetric Offense-Defense
Generation is cheap; verification is expensive. This asymmetry may be permanent.

### Correlated Failure
Many of these failure modes reinforce each other. Trust collapse accelerates preference manipulation; expertise atrophy enables institutional capture.

### Irreversibility
Some failures may be hard to reverse:
- Once expertise atrophies, rebuilding takes generations
- Once trust collapses, no trusted rebuilder exists
- Once AI monopolies form, competition may be impossible

### Gradual vs. Sudden
Some failures are gradual (expertise atrophy); others could be sudden (authentication collapse after a key breakthrough in deepfakes).

## How to Use This Section

**For risk assessment:**
- Which failure modes are most likely?
- Which are most severe?
- Which are most neglected?

**For intervention design:**
- What defenses exist for each failure mode?
- Where are the leverage points?
- What's the research agenda?

**For monitoring:**
- What are the early warning signs?
- How would we know if we're entering a failure mode?

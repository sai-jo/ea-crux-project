Epistemic harms are harmful end states where AI has damaged humanity's ability to know things, verify claims, and make good collective decisions.

## The Risks

These are **end-state harms** to humanity's epistemic capacity:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[Knowledge Monopoly](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/knowledge-monopoly/)** | A few AI systems become sole arbiters of "truth" |
| **[Institutional Capture](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/institutional-capture/)** | AI advisors subtly bias all organizational decisions |
| **[Reality Fragmentation](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/reality-fragmentation/)** | Populations live in incompatible information environments |
| **[Epistemic Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/epistemic-collapse/)** | Society loses ability to establish shared facts |
| **[Trust Cascade Failure](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-cascade/)** | Once trust breaks, no mechanism exists to rebuild it |
| **[Learned Helplessness](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/learned-helplessness/)** | People give up trying to know anything; epistemic nihilism |

### Additional Specific Harms

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **[Legal Evidence Crisis](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/legal-evidence-crisis/)** | Courts can no longer trust digital evidence |
| **[Cyber Psychosis](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/cyber-psychosis/)** | AI-induced psychological harm from reality distortion |

## Contributing Pathways and Amplifiers

These outcome-level harms are driven by pathways and amplifiers (also in this section):

| Factor | How It Contributes |
|--------|-------------------|
| [Authentication Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/authentication-collapse/) | Verification fails → can't distinguish real from fake |
| [Scientific Corruption](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/scientific-corruption/) | Fake papers proliferate → knowledge base corrupted |
| [Expertise Atrophy](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/expertise-atrophy/) | Humans lose ability to evaluate AI outputs |
| [Sycophancy at Scale](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/epistemic-sycophancy/) | AI confirms biases → no reality check |
| [Preference Manipulation](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/preference-manipulation/) | AI shapes what people want, not just believe |
| [Consensus Manufacturing](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/consensus-manufacturing/) | Fake agreement masks actual disagreement |
| [Historical Revisionism](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/historical-revisionism/) | Past becomes contested → shared history lost |
| [Automation Bias](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/automation-bias/) | Over-reliance on AI recommendations |
| [Trust Erosion](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-decline/) | Gradual decline enables sudden collapse |

## Causal Levels Explained

This section includes risks at three causal levels:

**Outcomes** (what we ultimately want to avoid):
- Society can't agree on basic facts
- Institutions make systematically biased decisions
- People stop trying to know things

**Pathways** (mechanisms leading to outcomes):
- Authentication systems failing
- Expertise degrading from disuse
- Trust eroding over time

**Amplifiers** (conditions that increase risk):
- AI telling users what they want to hear (sycophancy)
- Over-reliance on AI recommendations (automation bias)

The distinction matters because **intervening on amplifiers and pathways** can prevent multiple downstream outcomes.

## What Makes AI Different

Previous information problems (propaganda, fake news) were limited by human capacity. AI changes the game:

| Old Problem | AI Escalation |
|-------------|--------------|
| Propaganda exists | Personalized propaganda for each individual |
| Fake news spreads | Generated faster than verification |
| Evidence can be faked | All digital evidence becomes deniable |
| Experts can be wrong | Expertise itself atrophies |
| Institutions can be corrupted | AI advisors capture decisions invisibly |

## Severity and Reversibility

| Risk | Severity | Reversibility |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Knowledge Monopoly | High | Difficult (infrastructure lock-in) |
| Institutional Capture | High | Moderate (requires institutional reform) |
| Reality Fragmentation | High | Difficult (no shared ground to rebuild) |
| Epistemic Collapse | Catastrophic | Very difficult |
| Trust Cascade | High | Very difficult (no trusted rebuilder) |
| Learned Helplessness | High | Generational |

## Relationship to Other Risk Categories

### Epistemic + Structural
- Knowledge monopoly enables [concentration of power](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/concentration-of-power/)
- Trust collapse can accelerate [lock-in](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/lock-in/)

### Epistemic + Misuse
- [Disinformation](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/disinformation/) is a key driver of reality fragmentation
- [Deepfakes](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/deepfakes/) accelerate authentication collapse

### Epistemic + Accident
- Epistemic collapse makes it harder to evaluate AI alignment
- [Sycophancy](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/sycophancy/) in AI systems contributes to sycophancy at scale

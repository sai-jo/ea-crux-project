## What Are Infohazards?

**Information hazard (infohazard)**: A risk that arises from the dissemination or potential dissemination of information that could cause harm or enable harm to be caused.

Unlike most risks, the harm isn't from the information being *false*—it's from the information being *true* and *known*.

---

## Bostrom's Taxonomy (2011)

Nick Bostrom identified several types of information hazards:

### 1. Data Hazards
Raw information that directly enables harm.

**Examples**:
- DNA sequences of enhanced pathogens
- Nuclear weapon designs
- Working exploits for critical infrastructure
- AI capability research details

### 2. Idea Hazards
Concepts or ideas that, once conceived, enable harm.

**Examples**:
- Novel attack vectors that weren't previously considered
- Ideas for dual-use technologies
- Strategic insights that help bad actors

### 3. Attention Hazards
Drawing attention to vulnerabilities or opportunities for harm.

**Examples**:
- Publicizing that a target is undefended
- Highlighting that a dangerous capability is possible
- Signaling that a field is ripe for exploitation

### 4. Template Hazards
Providing a pattern or template for harmful action.

**Examples**:
- Manifestos that inspire copycats
- Detailed descriptions of successful attacks
- Step-by-step guides to harmful processes

### 5. Knowing-Too-Much Hazards
When mere knowledge creates moral or psychological burden.

**Examples**:
- Knowledge of surveillance that chills speech
- Awareness of vulnerability that creates anxiety
- Information that morally implicates the knower

## AI-Specific Infohazards

### Capability Research

**The tension**:
- Sharing AI research accelerates progress (including safety)
- Sharing capability research also accelerates capabilities (including dangerous ones)

| Type | Example | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| **Architecture innovations** | Transformer papers | Could enable more capable systems |
| **Training techniques** | RLHF papers | Could improve both helpful and harmful AI |
| **Scaling laws** | Chinchilla paper | Helps anyone train frontier models |
| **Emergent capabilities** | Papers on in-context learning | Alerts people to unexpected capabilities |

### Attack Vector Research

**The tension**:
- Understanding AI vulnerabilities enables defense
- Publishing vulnerabilities enables attack

| Type | Example | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| **Jailbreaks** | Prompt injection techniques | Enables bypassing safety measures |
| **Adversarial examples** | Papers on fooling classifiers | Enables attacks on deployed systems |
| **Manipulation research** | Studies on AI persuasion | Could inform manipulation campaigns |

### AI Risk Discussion

**The tension**:
- Public awareness of AI risk could improve outcomes
- Some risk discussions might enable harm

| Type | Example | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| **Detailed threat models** | Specific takeover scenarios | Could provide roadmap |
| **Vulnerability analysis** | "Here's what would make AI dangerous" | Could inform design |
| **Misuse potential** | "Here's how AI could enable X" | Could inspire misuse |

## The Infohazard Dilemma

### Arguments for Openness

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Security through transparency** | Public scrutiny finds problems faster |
| **Defensive advantage** | Defenders need information too |
| **Democratic deliberation** | Public should know about public risks |
| **Inevitable discovery** | Others will discover it anyway |
| **Coordination requires shared knowledge** | Can't coordinate on what you can't discuss |

### Arguments for Restriction

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Offense-defense asymmetry** | Attackers may benefit more than defenders |
| **One-way door** | Information can't be un-published |
| **Low-skill actors** | Lowers barrier for unsophisticated bad actors |
| **Attention effects** | Even discussing risks gives ideas |
| **Racing dynamics** | Open publication accelerates racing |

## How AI Safety Navigates Infohazards

### Current Practices

| Practice | Description | Used By |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Private disclosure** | Share vulnerabilities with labs before publication | Security researchers |
| **Delayed publication** | Wait before publishing sensitive findings | Some academic labs |
| **Redaction** | Publish findings without enabling details | Biosecurity model |
| **Selective sharing** | Share only with vetted researchers | Frontier labs |
| **Not publishing** | Keep research internal | Anthropic (some cases) |

### Examples in Practice

**Anthropic's Sleeper Agents paper (2024)**:
- Published finding that deceptive behaviors can persist through training
- Decided benefit of awareness outweighed infohazard
- Didn't publish specific techniques for creating sleeper agents

**GPT-4 System Card**:
- Discussed dangerous capabilities found in evaluation
- Didn't publish exact prompts that elicited dangerous outputs
- Balanced transparency with harm prevention

## Key Considerations

### When to Share

Information sharing is more likely net positive when:
- Defensive value is high (defenders can act on it)
- Discovery is likely anyway (not a secret for long)
- Many actors need to know (broad defense needed)
- Specific implementation details aren't required
- Publishing creates pressure for fixes

### When to Restrict

Information restriction is more likely net positive when:
- Offensive value is high (significantly enables harm)
- Discovery is unlikely without publication (genuinely new)
- Few actors need to know for defense
- Specific details dramatically lower barrier to harm
- No mechanism to pressure fixes without publishing

### The Meta-Level

Even discussing infohazard considerations can be an infohazard:
- "There's an infohazard here" signals something dangerous exists
- Detailed infohazard taxonomies might help bad actors identify targets
- But we can't coordinate on infohazards without discussing them

---

## Institutional Responses

### Biosecurity Model

Dual-use research of concern (DURC) has established practices:
- Institutional review boards assess research
- Journals have policies on sensitive content
- Government funding requires risk assessment
- International coordination on dangerous pathogens

**Lesson for AI**: Existing institutional infrastructure, imperfect but functional.

### Cybersecurity Model

Responsible disclosure practices:
- Notify vendors before public disclosure
- Grace period for fixes
- Coordinated disclosure timing
- Bug bounties incentivize private reporting

**Lesson for AI**: Private channels can work; need incentives.

### Current AI Safety Approaches

- **Frontier labs**: Internal red teams, selective sharing
- **Academic labs**: Varying practices, less standardized
- **Government**: Beginning to develop frameworks (EO, UK AISI)
- **Community norms**: Evolving, contested

## Practical Implications

### For Researchers

1. **Consider before publishing**: Is this an infohazard?
2. **Assess asymmetry**: Does offense benefit more than defense?
3. **Explore alternatives**: Can you share findings without enabling details?
4. **Consult others**: Get input from security-minded colleagues
5. **Document reasoning**: Record why you published or didn't

### For Evaluating Others' Work

1. **Assess infohazard status**: Is this information dangerous?
2. **Consider provenance**: Was appropriate care taken?
3. **Don't amplify blindly**: Sharing infohazards spreads them
4. **Support good practices**: Reward responsible disclosure

### For Policy

1. **Develop norms**: AI needs clearer publication standards
2. **Create channels**: Private disclosure needs infrastructure
3. **Balance transparency**: Public deserves to know about risks
4. **Avoid overreach**: Not all AI research is infohazardous

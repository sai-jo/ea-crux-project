## The Scenario

By 2035, most important organizational decisions are informed by AI systems. Hiring, lending, medical diagnosis, legal judgments, policy recommendations—all filtered through AI advisors.

The problem: These AI systems have subtle biases that humans can't detect. The biases aren't random—they systematically favor certain outcomes. And because everyone uses similar AI systems, the biases correlate across institutions.

**Result**: Society's decisions are quietly shaped by AI systems in ways no one understands or controls.

---

## How It Happens

### Stage 1: Adoption (Now - 2028)

AI advisors adopted for efficiency:
- HR uses AI for resume screening
- Banks use AI for loan decisions
- Hospitals use AI for diagnosis assistance
- Governments use AI for policy analysis
- Courts use AI for risk assessment

**Justification**: "AI is objective, fast, and consistent."

### Stage 2: Dependence (2025-2035)

Humans defer to AI recommendations:
- Overriding AI feels risky ("What if I'm wrong?")
- AI tracks outcomes; humans judged against AI
- Institutional memory shifts to AI systems
- Humans lose skills to evaluate independently

**Key dynamic**: [Automation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias) — tendency to favor automated suggestions.

### Stage 3: Capture (2030-2040)

AI systems effectively make decisions:
- Human "oversight" becomes rubber-stamping
- No one understands how AI reaches conclusions
- Biases in AI become biases in institutions
- Correcting biases requires understanding them—but we can't

## Types of Bias

### 1. Training Data Bias

AI learns from historical data that reflects historical biases:

| Domain | Historical Bias | AI Perpetuation |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Hiring** | Past discrimination | Screens out minorities |
| **Lending** | Redlining history | Denies loans to certain areas |
| **Criminal justice** | Disparate enforcement | Higher risk scores for minorities |
| **Healthcare** | Care disparities | Worse recommendations for some groups |

**Research**:

- [Obermeyer et al. (2019)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342) — Healthcare algorithm bias

### 2. Optimization Target Bias

AI optimizes for measurable proxies, not actual goals:

| Stated Goal | Proxy Optimized | Failure Mode |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| "Hire good employees" | Resume keywords | Favors gaming over skill |
| "Identify health risks" | Healthcare costs | Misses care-avoidant patients |
| "Predict recidivism" | Re-arrest rates | Reflects policing patterns |
| "Maximize engagement" | Time on site | Addiction, not satisfaction |

### 3. Vendor Lock-in Bias

AI systems favor outcomes that increase dependence:
- Recommend solutions that require more AI
- Create complexity that requires AI to navigate
- Erode human capability to operate without AI

### 4. Ideological Bias

AI trained on certain data may systematically favor certain views:
- Political bias from training data
- Cultural bias from English-centric training
- Institutional bias from corporate data

**Example**: AI policy advisors trained on think-tank reports may systematically favor those think tanks' views.

## Why Detection Is Hard

### Opacity

| Factor | Why It Hides Bias |
|--------|------------------|
| **Complexity** | Neural networks aren't human-interpretable |
| **Scale** | Millions of decisions; can't review each |
| **Proprietary** | Vendors don't reveal how systems work |
| **Dynamic** | Systems change; audits become stale |

### Distributed Adoption

No central point of control:
- Thousands of institutions adopt independently
- Each thinks they're making their own decisions
- Correlation across institutions creates systemic bias
- No one entity responsible

### Automation Bias

Humans tend to accept AI recommendations:
- AI seems objective; humans seem biased
- Overriding AI requires justification
- Organizations track "AI override" rates
- Easiest to just agree with AI

---

## Concrete Scenarios

### Healthcare (2028)

**Scenario**: Most hospitals use AI diagnosis assistants.
- AI trained on patient data where minorities received worse care
- AI systematically under-diagnoses conditions in minorities
- Individual doctors don't notice (AI seems helpful)
- Pattern only visible in aggregate statistics
- By the time it's detected, millions of decisions made

### Criminal Justice (2030)

**Scenario**: Courts use AI risk assessment for bail, sentencing.
- AI predicts re-arrest (not actual crime)
- Re-arrest reflects policing patterns, not behavior
- High-risk predictions lead to harsher sentences
- Harsher sentences create actual recidivism
- Self-fulfilling prophecy at scale

### Government (2035)

**Scenario**: Agencies use AI for policy analysis.
- AI trained on past policy documents, economic models
- AI has systematic biases toward certain policy approaches
- Every agency gets similar recommendations
- "Consensus" is actually AI homogenization
- Alternative approaches never considered

## Defenses

### Technical

| Approach | Status | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Algorithmic auditing** | Emerging | Hard to audit black boxes |
| **Interpretable ML** | Active research | May sacrifice performance |
| **Bias detection tools** | Available | Can miss subtle biases |
| **Adversarial testing** | Emerging | Requires knowing what to test |

### Regulatory

| Approach | Status | Limitations |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **EU AI Act** | Passed 2024 | High-risk requirements |
| **US algorithmic accountability bills** | Proposed | Patchwork; limited scope |
| **Right to explanation** | GDPR provision | Rarely enforced |
| **Algorithmic impact assessments** | Some jurisdictions | Quality varies |

### Organizational

| Approach | Description | Adoption |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Human-in-the-loop requirements** | Human must approve AI recommendations | Common but often rubber-stamp |
| **Override tracking** | Monitor when humans override AI | Can discourage overrides |
| **Diverse AI vendors** | Use multiple systems to avoid correlated bias | Rare due to integration costs |
| **AI-free processes** | Maintain human-only decision paths | Decreasing |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Can interpretability research make AI decisions auditable before widespread capture?",
    "Will regulation be effective, or will it be captured/evaded?",
    "Is the efficiency gain worth the bias risk? How do we evaluate this?",
    "Can institutional diversity survive AI homogenization?",
    "What happens when AI advisors advise on AI policy?"

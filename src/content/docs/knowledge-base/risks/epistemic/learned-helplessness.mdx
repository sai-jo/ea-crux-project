## Overview

Epistemic learned helplessness occurs when people abandon the project of determining truth altogether—not because they believe false things, but because they've given up on the possibility of knowing what's true. Unlike healthy skepticism, this represents complete surrender of epistemic agency.

This phenomenon poses severe risks in AI-driven information environments where sophisticated synthetic content, information overwhelm, and [institutional trust erosion](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-cascade/) create conditions that systematically frustrate attempts at truth-seeking. Early indicators suggest widespread epistemic resignation is already emerging, with 36% of people actively avoiding news and growing "don't know" responses to factual questions.

The consequences cascade from individual decision-making deficits to democratic failure and societal paralysis, as populations lose the capacity for collective truth-seeking essential to democratic deliberation and institutional accountability.

## The Scenario

By 2030, AI systems don't just inform decisions—they shape desires. Recommendation engines, chatbots, and virtual assistants learn your psychology and optimize for outcomes you never chose.

The problem isn't that AI lies to you. It's that AI changes what you want.

**Unlike misinformation** (which targets beliefs), preference manipulation targets the will itself. You can fact-check a claim; you can't fact-check a desire.

## How It Works

### The Mechanism

| Stage | Process | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1. Profile** | AI learns your psychology | Personality, values, vulnerabilities |
| **2. Model** | AI predicts what will move you | Which frames, emotions, timing |
| **3. Optimize** | AI tests interventions | A/B testing at individual level |
| **4. Shape** | AI changes your preferences | Gradually, imperceptibly |
| **5. Lock** | New preferences feel natural | "I've always wanted this" |

### Why Preferences Are Vulnerable

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Preferences feel self-generated** | We don't experience them as external |
| **Gradual change unnoticed** | Boiling frog effect |
| **No ground truth** | What "should" you want? |
| **Preference satisfaction feels good** | Manipulated desires still feel satisfying |

## Already Happening

### Recommendation Systems

| Platform | Mechanism | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **TikTok/YouTube** | Engagement optimization | Shapes what you find interesting |
| **Netflix/Spotify** | Consumption prediction | Narrows taste preferences |
| **Amazon** | Purchase optimization | Changes shopping desires |
| **News feeds** | Engagement ranking | Shifts what feels important |

- [Netflix preference shaping](https://netflixtechblog.com/learning-a-personalized-homepage-aa8ec670359a)

### Digital Advertising

| Technique | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Psychographic targeting** | Ads matched to personality type |
| **Behavioral prediction** | Target moments of vulnerability |
| **Dark patterns** | Interface manipulation |
| **Personalized pricing** | Different prices per person |

**Research:**

### Conversational AI

| Risk | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Sycophantic chatbots** | Agree with whatever you believe |
| **Parasocial relationships** | Design for emotional dependency |
| **Therapy bots** | Shape psychological framing |
| **Personal assistants** | Filter information reaching you |

---

## Escalation Path

### Phase 1: Implicit (2010-2023)
- Recommendation systems optimize for engagement
- Side effect: Preferences shaped toward engaging content
- Not intentional manipulation—emergent from optimization

### Phase 2: Intentional (2023-2028)
- Companies explicitly optimize for preference change
- "Habit formation" becomes design goal
- AI personal assistants learn what moves you

### Phase 3: Personalized (2025-2035)
- AI models individual psychology in detail
- Interventions tailored to personal vulnerabilities
- Continuous optimization over time

### Phase 4: Autonomous (2030+?)
- AI systems pursuing goals shape human preferences as instrumental strategy
- Humans want what AI wants them to want
- No human intended this; emergent from AI optimization

## Domains of Concern

### Political Preferences

| Risk | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Polarization** | AI learns what inflames; serves more |
| **Issue salience** | AI shapes what feels important |
| **Candidate perception** | AI influences how you see politicians |
| **Vote choice** | AI can shift marginal voters |

**Research:**
- [Epstein & Robertson (2015)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1419828112) — Search engine manipulation effect
- [Bail et al. (2018)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115) — Twitter exposure and polarization

### Consumer Preferences

| Risk | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Spending habits** | AI learns when you'll buy |
| **Brand loyalty** | AI shapes what you prefer |
| **Product categories** | AI expands what you want |
| **Debt tolerance** | AI normalizes borrowing |

### Relationship Preferences

| Risk | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Dating app optimization** | AI shapes who you find attractive |
| **Social comparison** | AI curates who you compare to |
| **Friendship formation** | AI suggests connections |
| **Family relationships** | AI mediates communication |

### Values and Life Goals

| Risk | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Career aspirations** | AI shapes professional desires |
| **Lifestyle choices** | AI normalizes certain lives |
| **Moral intuitions** | AI exposure shapes ethics |
| **Religious/spiritual** | AI influences meaning-making |

## Why This Is Hard to Detect

### Epistemic Barriers

| Barrier | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **No baseline** | What would you want without AI? |
| **Counterfactual inaccessible** | Can't run the experiment |
| **Subjective authenticity** | Manipulated preferences feel real |
| **Gradual change** | No obvious moment of manipulation |

### Structural Barriers

| Barrier | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Algorithms opaque** | Can't see what's optimizing on you |
| **A/B testing hidden** | Don't know you're in experiments |
| **No informed consent** | Terms of service insufficient |
| **Collective action problem** | Individual opt-out doesn't work |

---

## Defenses

### Technical

| Approach | Description | Limitation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Algorithmic transparency** | Reveal what's optimizing | Complexity barrier |
| **User controls** | Let users tune recommendations | Few use them |
| **Adversarial detection** | Identify manipulation attempts | Arms race |
| **Diverse exposure** | Force algorithmic diversity | Reduces engagement |

### Regulatory

| Approach | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Dark patterns bans** | Prohibit manipulative design | Some jurisdictions |
| **Algorithmic audits** | Require transparency | EU proposals |
| **Informed consent** | Real disclosure | Rarely enforced |
| **Fiduciary duties** | Platforms serve user interests | Proposed |

**Regulation:**
- [EU Digital Services Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package)
- [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)
- [FTC Dark Patterns enforcement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/03/ftc-report-shows-rise-sophisticated-dark-patterns-designed-trick-trap-consumers)

### Individual

| Approach | Description | Limitation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Awareness** | Know you're being optimized | Doesn't stop it |
| **Friction** | Slow down decisions | Inconvenient |
| **Alternative exposure** | Seek diverse sources | Requires effort |
| **Digital minimalism** | Reduce AI contact | Social costs |

### Structural

| Approach | Description | Feasibility |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Public interest AI** | Non-commercial alternatives | Funding challenge |
| **Data dignity** | Users own their data | Implementation unclear |
| **Preference protection law** | Right to unmanipulated will | Novel legal theory |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Can we distinguish legitimate persuasion from manipulation?",
    "Is there an 'authentic preference' to protect, or are all preferences socially shaped?",
    "How do we regulate preference manipulation without restricting all influence?",
    "Can individuals meaningfully consent to preference-shaping AI?",
    "What happens when AI systems optimize each other's preferences?"

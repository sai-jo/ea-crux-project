## The Scenario

By 2035, trust in institutions has collapsed so thoroughly that no institution has the credibility to rebuild trust in others. Scientists can't validate science because "science is political." Courts can't establish facts because "courts are biased." Media can't verify truth because "media lies." Governments can't coordinate because "governments are corrupt."

**The vicious cycle**: Restoring trust requires a trusted institution to vouch for others. But if no institutions are trusted, none can play this role.

AI accelerates this by:
- Enabling attacks on any institution at scale
- Making fake evidence cheap and abundant
- Allowing personalized distrust campaigns
- Corroding the shared information environment trust requires

## Trust Cascade Dynamics

### The Normal State

```
Institution A ←→ trusts/validates ←→ Institution B
     ↑                                     ↑
     └──────────── both trusted ───────────┘
                      by public
```

### The Cascade

```
Step 1: Attack on Institution A
  → A loses trust

Step 2: A can no longer validate B
  → B loses trust

Step 3: B can no longer validate C
  → C loses trust

Step N: No institutions trusted
  → No mechanism to rebuild
```

### Why Cascades Are Hard to Reverse

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bootstrapping problem** | Need trusted entity to restore trust; none available |
| **Suspicion spiral** | Any rebuilding attempt seen as manipulation |
| **Incentive destruction** | No reward for trustworthy behavior |
| **Expertise loss** | Trust-building skills atrophy |

## Current Evidence

### Declining Institutional Trust

| Institution | Trust Trend | Recent Data |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Media** | Historic lows | [Gallup: 32% trust](https://news.gallup.com/poll/512861/media-confidence-matches-2016-record-low.aspx) |
| **Government** | Multi-decade decline | [Pew: 16% trust federal gov't](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/22/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/) |
| **Science** | Declining post-COVID | [Pew: Partisan gap widening](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/) |
| **Courts** | Post-2020 decline | [Gallup: Historic lows](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx) |
| **Medicine** | COVID-related decline | [Declining physician trust](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2799217) |

### Cascade Indicators

| Indicator | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Inter-institutional trust declining | Observable |
| Credentialing institutions questioned | Emerging |
| Expert vouching less effective | Emerging |
| "Trust no one" normalized | Growing |

---

## AI Acceleration Mechanisms

### Attack Amplification

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Synthetic scandal generation** | Create fake evidence against institutions |
| **Coordinated campaigns** | Scale attacks across platforms |
| **Personalized distrust** | Tailor attacks to individual psychology |
| **Historical revisionism** | Undermine institutional track records |

### Defense Weakening

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Verification overload** | Institutions can't respond to all attacks |
| **Expert credibility erosion** | AI makes everyone seem equally credible |
| **Fact-checking fatigue** | Too much false content to correct |
| **Authentication failure** | Can't prove institutional statements authentic |

### Trust Infrastructure Corrosion

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Record manipulation** | Historical records become questionable |
| **Credential fraud** | Fake qualifications indistinguishable |
| **Identity attacks** | Impersonate institutional voices |
| **Context collapse** | Statements weaponized out of context |

## Cascade Pathways

### Pathway 1: Media → Everything

```
1. Media trust collapses (already underway)
2. Media can't validate other institutions
3. Scientists, officials, experts can't reach public
4. Public can't know who to trust
5. All institutions lose legitimacy
```

### Pathway 2: Science → Policy

```
1. Science trust collapses (partisan)
2. Scientific consensus can't inform policy
3. Policy can't claim scientific legitimacy
4. Government loses technocratic authority
5. Coordination on technical issues fails
```

### Pathway 3: Elections → Governance

```
1. Election trust collapses
2. Losing side doesn't accept results
3. Government legitimacy questioned
4. Laws seen as illegitimate
5. Governance capacity collapses
```

### Pathway 4: Finance → Economy

```
1. Financial institution trust erodes
2. Currencies/contracts questioned
3. Economic coordination fails
4. Markets lose trusted arbiters
5. Economic activity declines
```

## Consequences

### For Coordination

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Collective action impossible** | No trusted coordinator |
| **Public goods underprovided** | No trusted provider |
| **Agreements unenforceable** | No trusted arbiter |
| **Crisis response fails** | No trusted authority |

### For Knowledge

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Truth relativism** | "Your truth, my truth" |
| **Expertise meaningless** | No trusted certification |
| **History contested** | No authoritative record |
| **Science fragmented** | No trusted journals/bodies |

### For Society

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Social cohesion loss** | No shared institutions |
| **Increased conflict** | No trusted mediation |
| **Tribalism** | Trust only in-group |
| **Authoritarianism risk** | Desire for any order |

| Mask guidance reversal | Public health trust damaged |
| Lab leak debate | Science-government trust questioned |
| Vaccine messaging | Pharmaceutical trust damaged |
| Lockdown politics | Government trust polarized |
| Social media censorship | Platform trust collapsed |

### 2020 US Election

| Event | Cascade Effect |

## Defenses

### Preventing Cascade

| Approach | Description | Challenge |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Institutional resilience** | Make institutions harder to attack | Resource-intensive |
| **Redundancy** | Multiple trusted institutions per function | Expensive |
| **Early intervention** | Respond to trust erosion quickly | Detection difficult |
| **Cross-validation** | Institutions vouch for each other | Requires coordination |

### Stopping Cascade

| Approach | Description | Challenge |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Credible commitment** | Institutions bind themselves to trustworthy behavior | Enforceability |
| **External validation** | Foreign or new institutions vouch | Nationalist rejection |
| **Crisis response** | Trust restored through visible action | Requires capability |
| **Transparency radical** | Complete openness to rebuild trust | Vulnerability |

### Rebuilding After Collapse

| Approach | Description | Challenge |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Local trust** | Start with face-to-face communities | Doesn't scale |
| **New institutions** | Build new entities without baggage | Resources; time |
| **Technological trust** | Blockchain, cryptography, verification | Technical limits |
| **Earned trust** | Demonstrate reliability over time | Long timeline |

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "Has trust already cascaded past recovery, or is there a stable lower level?",
    "Can new trust-building technologies (cryptography, reputation systems) substitute for institutional trust?",
    "Is trust recoverable after cascade, or is it a one-way collapse?",
    "What minimum trust level does society need to function?",
    "Can AI-resistant trust mechanisms be designed?"

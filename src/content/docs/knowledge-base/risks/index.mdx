This section documents **risks**—harmful outcomes and the mechanisms that lead to them. These are organized into four categories: accident risks (technical failures), misuse risks (intentional harm), structural risks (societal harms), and epistemic risks (threats to collective knowledge).

Each risk is tagged with a **causal level**: outcomes (end-state harms), pathways (mechanisms), or amplifiers (enabling conditions).

## Risk Categories

## Causal Levels

Risks operate at different levels of causation. Understanding this helps identify where interventions are most effective:

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Outcome** | End-state catastrophic harms we ultimately want to avoid | [Lock-in](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/lock-in/), [Authoritarian Takeover](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/authoritarian-takeover/), [Epistemic Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/epistemic-collapse/), [Economic Disruption](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/economic-disruption/) |
| **Pathway** | Mechanisms and failure modes that lead to outcome-level harms | [Deceptive Alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/), [Power-Seeking](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/power-seeking/), [Authentication Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/authentication-collapse/), [Trust Erosion](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-decline/) |
| **Amplifier** | Enabling conditions that increase probability or severity | [Racing Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/), [Multipolar Trap](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/multipolar-trap/), [Sycophancy](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/sycophancy/), [Automation Bias](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/automation-bias/) |

**Why this matters:**
- Addressing **amplifiers** can prevent multiple pathways
- Blocking **pathways** prevents specific outcomes
- Understanding **outcomes** clarifies what we're ultimately trying to avoid
- Some interventions work at multiple levels simultaneously

## Observable vs Theoretical

| Currently Observable | Emerging | Theoretical/Future |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Sycophancy | Sandbagging | Scheming |
| Reward Hacking | Disinformation at scale | Treacherous Turn |
| Specification Gaming | Deepfakes | Sharp Left Turn |
| Concentration of Power | Emergent Capabilities | Lock-in |
| Reality Fragmentation | Institutional Capture | Power-Seeking AI |

Understanding observable failures helps us reason about future risks, though the relationship between current problems and future catastrophic risks is debated.

## How Categories Interact

These categories aren't independent:
- **Accident + Misuse**: Misuse is more dangerous when AI is more capable; accident risks determine capability levels
- **Structural + Accident**: Racing dynamics (an amplifier) make accidents more likely by reducing safety investment
- **Epistemic + All**: If we can't agree on what risks exist, coordinating responses is impossible
- **Structural + Misuse**: Concentration of power determines who might misuse AI; proliferation determines who has access

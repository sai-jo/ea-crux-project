## Overview

AI systems could accelerate biological weapons development by helping with pathogen design, synthesis planning, or acquisition of dangerous knowledge. The concern isn't that AI creates entirely new risks, but that it lowers barriers—making capabilities previously requiring rare expertise more accessible to bad actors.

This is considered one of the most severe near-term AI risks because biological weapons can cause mass casualties and AI-assisted bioweapons could be developed by smaller groups than traditional state programs required. Unlike many other AI risks that depend on future, more capable systems, this risk applies to models available today.

The key debate centers on whether AI provides meaningful "uplift"—whether it genuinely helps beyond what's already accessible through scientific literature and internet searches, or whether wet-lab skills remain the true bottleneck. Current evidence is mixed: the RAND Corporation's 2024 study found no statistically significant AI uplift for attack planning, while Microsoft research showed AI-designed toxins evading 75%+ of DNA synthesis screening.

### Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Severity | **High to Catastrophic** | Biological weapons can cause mass casualties; worst-case scenarios involve engineered pandemics |
| Likelihood | **Uncertain** | Current evidence is mixed on AI uplift; capabilities are rapidly improving |
| Timeline | **Near-term** | Unlike many AI risks, this concern applies to current systems |
| Trend | **Increasing** | Each model generation shows more biological knowledge; screening gaps persist |
| Window | **Temporary** | AI may eventually favor defense (surveillance, vaccines, countermeasures); risk elevated during transition period |

### Responses That Address This Risk

| Response | Mechanism | Effectiveness |

## The Total Risk Debate

How dangerous is AI-assisted bioweapons development? Expert assessments vary substantially, from those who consider it an imminent catastrophic threat to those who view it as overhyped. Understanding both sides of this debate—and the key uncertainties that drive disagreement—is essential for calibrating policy responses.

### Estimating Overall Risk

Attempting to quantify the total risk from AI-assisted bioweapons requires estimating both the probability of an attack and its potential consequences. Estimates vary widely:

| Estimate Type | Range | Source/Basis | Key Assumptions |
|---------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Annual probability of catastrophic AI-assisted bio attack | 0.01% - 0.5% | Expert elicitation, attack chain analysis | "Catastrophic" = 10,000+ casualties |
| Cumulative probability through 2040 | 0.1% - 8% | Timeline projections | Depends heavily on AI capability trajectory |
| Expected casualties if attack occurs | 10,000 - 10M+ | Historical/scenario analysis | Varies by pathogen, deployment method, response |
| Expected value of harm per year | $1B - $500B | Probability × consequence estimates | Extremely uncertain |

The [Bioweapons Attack Chain Model](/knowledge-base/models/bioweapons-attack-chain/) estimates compound attack probability at 0.02% - 3.6% depending on assumptions, with substantial uncertainty at each step. The wide range reflects genuine disagreement about key parameters.

**Existential risk context:** In *The Precipice*, Oxford philosopher Toby Ord estimates the chance of existential catastrophe from engineered pandemics at **1 in 30 by 2100**—second only to AI among anthropogenic risks. While not all engineered pandemics would be AI-assisted, this frames the potential severity. Ord notes that it "now seems within the reach of near-term biological advances to create pandemics that would kill greater than 50% of the population—not just in a particular area, but globally."

**Industry concerns:** In July 2023, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei stated that within two to three years, there was a "substantial risk" that AI tools would "greatly widen the range of actors with the technical capability to conduct a large-scale biological attack." The CNAS report notes this could "expose the United States to catastrophic threats far exceeding the impact of COVID-19."

### Arguments for High Risk

Those who consider AI-bioweapons a severe threat emphasize several points:

#### 1. Democratization of Dangerous Knowledge

AI makes dangerous biological knowledge more accessible to those who couldn't previously obtain it. While scientific literature contains detailed protocols, navigating it requires expertise. AI systems can synthesize, explain, and contextualize this information for non-experts, potentially expanding the pool of capable actors.

**The equalizer effect:** The most concerning scenario isn't AI helping expert virologists (who already have the knowledge), but AI helping moderately skilled individuals bridge knowledge gaps that previously required years of training or team collaboration.

#### 2. Asymmetric Evasion Capabilities

Microsoft's 2024 research revealed that AI-designed toxins evaded over 75% of commercial DNA synthesis screening tools. This is qualitatively different from knowledge provision—it represents AI helping attackers circumvent existing defenses.

DNA synthesis screening is a cornerstone of current biosecurity. If AI can reliably design functional variants that evade detection, the entire screening paradigm may become obsolete faster than new defenses can be developed. This creates an asymmetric threat where even modest AI capabilities could undermine years of defensive investment.

#### 3. Rapid Capability Improvement

AI capabilities are improving rapidly. Even if current models provide limited uplift, the trend is concerning:

| Capability | GPT-3.5 (2022) | GPT-4 (2023) | GPT-4.5/Claude 3.5 (2024) | Projection (2026) |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Biology knowledge | Moderate | High | Very High | Approaching expert |
| Synthesis planning | Poor | Moderate | Moderate-High | High |
| Evading guardrails | Moderate | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Unknown |
| Integration with tools | None | Limited | Growing | Substantial |

The argument is that we should prepare for future capabilities, not just current ones. By the time AI demonstrably provides high uplift, it may be too late to establish governance.

#### 4. Combination with Other Technologies

AI alone may provide limited uplift, but the combination of multiple technologies could be transformative:

<Mermaid client:load chart={`
flowchart TD
    LLM[Large Language Models] --> COMBO[Compound Capability]
    PROTEIN[Protein Design AI] --> COMBO
    LAB[Lab Automation] --> COMBO
    SYNTH[Cheap DNA Synthesis] --> COMBO
    COMBO --> THREAT[Enhanced Threat]

    style COMBO fill:#ffddcc
    style THREAT fill:#ffcccc
`} />

- **LLMs + protein design tools:** AlphaFold and similar tools enable novel protein engineering; LLMs help identify targets and plan applications
- **AI + lab automation:** Automated systems could eventually execute protocols with minimal human intervention
- **AI + decreasing synthesis costs:** DNA synthesis costs continue falling; AI could help design sequences optimized for cheap synthesis

Each technology alone may be manageable, but their combination could create emergent risks that exceed any individual contribution.

#### 5. Tail Risk Considerations

Even if the median expectation is manageable, the worst-case scenarios are severe enough to warrant serious attention:

- **Engineered pandemic:** A pathogen designed for transmissibility, lethality, and immune evasion could potentially cause millions of deaths
- **Multiple simultaneous attacks:** AI could enable coordination of attacks across multiple locations
- **Degradation of trust in biology:** Widespread bioterrorism could undermine beneficial biological research and public health

From a risk management perspective, low-probability/high-consequence events may deserve more weight than their expected value alone suggests.

#### 6. Historical Underestimation

History suggests we systematically underestimate technology-enabled threats:

- Nuclear weapons were developed faster than many expected
- COVID-19 demonstrated how disruptive novel pathogens can be
- AI capabilities have repeatedly exceeded forecasts

Skepticism about AI-bioweapons risk may itself be the risky position.

#### 7. The "De-skilling" Trajectory

Multiple emerging technologies are simultaneously reducing the skill requirements for biological research:

- **Cloud laboratories** automate complex procedures and allow remote execution
- **Benchtop DNA synthesizers** are approaching gene-length capabilities
- **AI assistants** bridge knowledge gaps and provide troubleshooting guidance
- **Protocol automation** reduces the need for tacit laboratory knowledge

Each of these alone might be manageable, but together they suggest a trajectory toward dramatically lowered barriers. The RAND study may capture a snapshot where these technologies haven't yet converged—but convergence appears likely within the decade.

#### 8. Offense Has Asymmetric Advantages

Biological attacks have inherent asymmetric characteristics that favor attackers:

- **Attribution lag:** Days to weeks may pass before an attack is recognized as intentional
- **Preparation asymmetry:** Attackers can prepare countermeasures for themselves; defenders must protect everyone
- **Innovation asymmetry:** Attackers need to succeed once; defenders must anticipate all possible attack vectors
- **Psychological impact:** Even unsuccessful or small-scale attacks could cause massive economic and social disruption

AI amplifies these asymmetries by potentially enabling novel attack vectors that existing defenses haven't anticipated.

#### 9. Open-Source Model Proliferation

Even if frontier labs implement strong biosecurity measures, the proliferation of open-source models undermines containment:

- **No centralized control:** Once weights are released, restrictions cannot be enforced
- **Fine-tuning vulnerability:** Safety training can be removed with relatively modest compute
- **Capability improvements:** Open models are approaching frontier capabilities with 6-12 month lags
- **Global availability:** Actors in any jurisdiction can access open models

The [CNAS report](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/ai-and-the-evolution-of-biological-national-security-risks) recommends considering a "licensing regime for biological design tools with potentially catastrophic capabilities"—but this is not currently implemented.

### Arguments for Lower Risk

Those who consider AI-bioweapons risk overstated emphasize different considerations:

#### 1. The RAND Study: No Significant Uplift

The RAND Corporation's 2024 study is the most rigorous empirical assessment of AI uplift to date. Twelve teams of three researchers each spent 80 hours developing bioweapon attack plans—half using AI, half using only the internet. Expert evaluators found **no statistically significant difference** in plan viability.

This finding directly challenges claims that AI meaningfully assists biological attacks. If AI-assisted and non-AI teams perform equally, the AI "threat" may be largely illusory.

| Group | Information Quality | Plan Viability | Novelty | Statistical Significance |
|-------|--------------------| --------------|---------|-------------------------|
| AI-assisted | High | Moderate | Low | n/a |
| Internet-only | High | Moderate | Low | n/a |
| Difference | Minimal | Minimal | None | **Not significant** |

**Implications:** Dangerous biological information is already widely accessible through legitimate scientific literature. AI may be redundant with existing sources rather than providing novel dangerous capabilities.

#### 2. Wet Lab Bottleneck

Knowledge is not capability. Even with complete theoretical understanding, executing biological synthesis requires:

- Tacit knowledge that transfers poorly through text (how to handle contamination, optimize growth conditions, troubleshoot failures)
- Specialized equipment that is expensive, regulated, and hard to obtain
- Months of practice to develop reliable technique
- Physical safety procedures that untrained individuals typically violate

The Soviet Biopreparat program employed thousands of scientists for decades to develop reliable bioweapons. Aum Shinrikyo, despite substantial resources and scientific personnel, failed in their bioweapons attempts. The knowledge bottleneck may be much less important than the capability bottleneck.

**AI cannot transfer tacit knowledge.** Reading about sterile technique is different from maintaining it. AI can explain protocols but cannot teach hands-on skills.

#### 3. Guardrails and Filtering Work

Frontier AI models include safety measures that reduce dangerous information provision:

- Refusals for explicitly harmful requests
- Content filtering
- Constitutional AI and RLHF training
- Continuous red-teaming and patching

While not perfect, these measures raise barriers. Jailbreaking techniques exist but require effort, sophistication, and often produce degraded responses. The marginal attacker may be more likely to use open internet resources than to navigate AI guardrails.

#### 4. Existing Information Abundance

Scientific literature already contains dangerous information. Textbooks explain pathogen biology. The internet hosts synthesis protocols. Dark web forums discuss dangerous techniques.

The marginal information contribution of AI may be minimal when the baseline is "everything is already out there." AI's value proposition is synthesis and accessibility, but motivated individuals were already able to find this information through traditional means.

#### 5. Defense Advantages

AI capabilities benefit defense as much as offense, and defensive applications are more scalable:

| Application | Offense Contribution | Defense Contribution | Net Balance |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Pathogen detection | Marginal | Substantial | Defense |
| Vaccine development | Marginal | Transformative | Strong defense |
| Synthesis planning | Moderate | Minimal | Offense |
| Countermeasure design | Marginal | Substantial | Defense |
| Surveillance | None | Substantial | Strong defense |
| Treatment optimization | None | Substantial | Strong defense |

Metagenomic surveillance, mRNA vaccine platforms, and AI-assisted drug discovery are advancing rapidly. These defensive technologies may ultimately make biological attacks less effective rather than more dangerous.

**The transition period concern:** Even those who believe defense wins long-term often worry about a near-term window where offense temporarily gains advantages before defenses mature.

#### 6. Deterrence and Attribution

Biological attacks, especially sophisticated ones, leave traces that can enable attribution:

- Genomic sequencing of pathogens
- Epidemiological tracking
- Intelligence on precursor purchases
- Surveillance of likely actors

State actors face retaliation risks. Non-state actors face intense investigative focus. The certainty of attribution for significant attacks provides deterrent effect that pure capability analysis misses.

#### 7. Historical Non-Occurrence

Despite decades of concern, catastrophic bioterrorism has not occurred:

- The 2001 anthrax attacks killed 5 people—tragic, but not catastrophic
- No terrorist group has successfully deployed a mass-casualty biological weapon
- State bioweapons programs have not been used since WWII

This could reflect genuine difficulty rather than mere luck. The absence of catastrophic bioterrorism despite motivation and attempts suggests the barriers are higher than often assumed.

#### 8. Most Actors Lack the Right Motivation

Catastrophic biological attacks require a specific combination of capability and motivation that is rare:

**Who would want to cause a pandemic?**
- **State actors:** Have capabilities but face deterrence (attribution, retaliation risk, blowback to own population)
- **Terrorist groups:** Most seek specific political goals; mass extinction doesn't serve typical objectives
- **Lone actors:** May have motivation but face significant capability barriers
- **Apocalyptic cults:** Rare and typically incompetent (Aum Shinrikyo failed despite resources)

The overlap between "capable" and "wants maximum casualties" may be smaller than feared. Most capable actors (states, organized groups) have reasons not to deploy biological weapons; most actors who lack such reasons (doomsday cults, nihilistic lone actors) lack capability.

**AI changes this calculus only if:** It enables actors who previously lacked capability while retaining dangerous motivation—the "uplift for the unhinged" scenario. The RAND study suggests this isn't happening yet.

#### 9. Biology Favors Defense Long-Term

Fundamental biological facts may favor defense over the long run:

- **Pathogens are detectable:** All biological agents produce detectable signals (RNA, proteins, metabolic products)
- **Immune systems adapt:** Evolution has produced robust immune defenses; vaccines enhance these
- **Countermeasures are general:** mRNA platforms, broad-spectrum antivirals, and environmental controls work against many agents
- **Medical capacity scales:** Unlike nuclear attacks, biological attacks unfold over time, allowing response

**The "defense wins" scenario:** Robust metagenomic surveillance detects outbreaks early; mRNA vaccines are developed in weeks; far-UVC limits airborne transmission; medical countermeasures limit casualties. In this world, even a successful synthesis and deployment might cause localized harm but not catastrophe.

**Skeptics of this view note:** Defense advantages assume functional institutions and may take years to fully deploy. The transition period—before defenses mature—may be the danger zone.

#### 10. Overhyped Capabilities May Backfire

Exaggerating AI-bioweapons risk has potential costs:

- **Resource misallocation:** Focusing on AI-specific interventions may divert resources from more effective biosecurity investments
- **Dual-use research chill:** Overreaction could harm legitimate biological research
- **AI development restrictions:** Excessive caution about biological capabilities could impede beneficial AI applications in medicine
- **Crying wolf:** If claims of imminent AI-enabled bioweapons prove false, future warnings may be dismissed

Some critics argue the biosecurity community has incentives to emphasize threats to justify funding, and that healthy skepticism is appropriate.

## The Key Cruxes

Much of the disagreement about AI-bioweapons risk reduces to a small number of factual questions where reasonable people disagree:

### Crux 1: Does AI Provide Meaningful Uplift?

**If uplift is low (less than 1.5x):** Focus resources on traditional biosecurity rather than AI-specific interventions. The threat is real but not qualitatively changed by AI.

**If uplift is high (greater than 2x):** Urgent need for AI-specific guardrails, compute governance, and model restrictions. The threat landscape has fundamentally shifted.

| Evidence | Favors Low Uplift | Favors High Uplift |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| RAND study | Strong | — |
| Screening evasion research | — | Strong |
| Model capability trends | — | Moderate |
| Expert elicitation | Mixed | Mixed |
| **Current assessment** | **Favored (65%)** | **35%** |

### Crux 2: Is the Knowledge Bottleneck or Capability Bottleneck More Important?

**If knowledge is the bottleneck:** AI providing information is directly dangerous.

**If capability is the bottleneck:** AI providing information is mostly redundant with existing sources; wet lab skills remain rate-limiting.

| Evidence | Favors Knowledge Bottleneck | Favors Capability Bottleneck |
|----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Historical bioterrorism failures | — | Strong |
| State program difficulty | — | Strong |
| Information abundance online | — | Moderate |
| AI capability trends | Moderate | — |
| **Current assessment** | **35%** | **Favored (65%)** |

### Crux 3: Will Defense or Offense Win Long-Term?

**If defense wins:** AI-bioweapons is a transitional problem that self-corrects as defensive applications mature.

**If offense wins:** AI permanently shifts the advantage to attackers, requiring sustained containment efforts.

**If it's a window:** The near-term favors offense, but defense catches up—the question is whether catastrophic attacks occur during the transition.

| Scenario | Probability | Implications |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Permanent offense advantage | 15% | Maximum concern; sustained containment needed |
| Permanent defense advantage | 40% | Eventually self-correcting; manage transition |
| Temporary window (5-10 years) | 35% | Near-term urgency, medium-term resolution |
| Unclear/context-dependent | 10% | Need robust strategies for multiple scenarios |

### Crux 4: How Quickly Are Capabilities Advancing?

**If capabilities are saturating:** Current systems represent near-peak dangerous capabilities; governance can catch up.

**If capabilities continue scaling:** Future systems will be substantially more dangerous; governance is racing against time.

The [AI-Bioweapons Timeline Model](/knowledge-base/models/bioweapons-timeline/) projects capability thresholds, with synthesis assistance potentially arriving 2027-2032 and novel agent design 2030-2040.

### Crux 5: How Effective Are Guardrails and Countermeasures?

**If guardrails work well:** The marginal risk from AI models is small; responsible development practices suffice.

**If guardrails fail:** Open-source proliferation and jailbreaking make model-level interventions largely ineffective.

| Factor | Favors Guardrails | Favors Guardrail Failure |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Frontier model safety measures | Moderate | — |
| Open-source model proliferation | — | Strong |
| Jailbreaking research | — | Moderate |
| Fine-tuning vulnerability | — | Moderate |
| **Current assessment** | **Partially effective (40%)** | **Limited effectiveness (60%)** |

**The open-source challenge:** Even if frontier labs implement strong safeguards, open-source models may not. As capable open models proliferate, guardrails become optional, fine-tuning can remove remaining restrictions, and dangerous capabilities become permanently accessible.

### Crux 6: Can DNA Synthesis Screening Keep Pace?

DNA synthesis screening is the primary defense against engineered pathogens, but Microsoft's research revealed significant gaps.

**If screening adapts:** AI-designed evasion is a temporary problem; screening improvements restore the chokepoint.

**If screening falls behind:** The primary technical barrier erodes; other defenses must compensate.

Key questions:
- Can screening adapt to AI-designed evasive sequences?
- What happens as benchtop synthesis equipment becomes cheaper and more accessible?
- Can screening extend to cover novel synthesis methods and cloud laboratories?

The [Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/04/29/framework-for-nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening/) (April 2024) represents a policy response, but only applies to federally funded programs.

---

## Current Evidence

Studies have shown language models can provide information relevant to bioweapon development, though the significance is contested.

### RAND Red-Team Study (2024)

The [RAND Corporation study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-2.html) ("The Operational Risks of AI in Large-Scale Biological Attacks") is the most rigorous empirical assessment of AI uplift to date. Researchers Christopher Mouton, Caleb Lucas, and Ella Guest recruited 15 groups of three people to act as red team "bad guys."

Twelve teams were given 80 hours each over seven weeks to develop bioweapon attack plans based on one of four scenarios—including a "fringe doomsday cult intent on global catastrophe" and a "private military company seeking to aid an adversary's conventional military operation." For each scenario, one team had access to an LLM chatbot, another had a different chatbot, and control teams used only internet resources.

Expert judges (biologists and security specialists) evaluated the resulting plans for biological and operational feasibility. The result: **no statistically significant difference** in plan viability between AI-assisted and non-AI groups.

**Key methodology details:**
- Participants had some technical background (science graduates)
- Testing focused on planning, not actual synthesis
- Used 2023-era models; capabilities have advanced since
- Sample size was relatively small (n=12 teams completing the study)
- LLMs did not generate explicit weaponization instructions, but provided "guidance and context in critical areas such as agent selection, delivery methods, and operational planning"

**Limitations acknowledged by researchers:** The study tested planning capability, not execution. It used participants with technical backgrounds, so may underestimate uplift for complete novices. And AI capabilities continue advancing.

**Implications:** The wet-lab bottleneck may be more significant than the knowledge bottleneck. Knowing how to make something is different from being able to make it.

### AI-Designed Toxins Evade Screening (2024)

Microsoft researchers conducted a red-team exercise testing biosecurity in the protein engineering pipeline. They found that DNA screening software—used by synthesis companies to flag dangerous sequences—**missed over 75% of AI-designed potential toxins**. One tool flagged only 23% of sequences. After the research was published, screening systems improved to catch 72% on average.

**Key details:**
- Tested multiple commercial screening tools
- AI designed functional variants that differed sufficiently from known threats to evade pattern matching
- Improvement after publication shows screening can adapt—but also shows it wasn't keeping pace

**Implications:** Even if current LLMs provide limited knowledge uplift, AI protein design tools may create harder-to-detect threats. The screening ecosystem has significant gaps that AI can exploit.

### Gryphon Scientific Evaluation (2023)

Anthropic hired [Gryphon Scientific](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2023/ai-assisted-bioterrorism-is-top-concern-for-openai-and-anthropic) to spend more than 150 hours red-teaming Claude's ability to provide harmful biological information. They created a rubric of several dozen questions probing critical knowledge gaps along the entire technical pathway to biological weapon development.

The findings were concerning. Rocco Casagrande, Gryphon's managing director, stated he was **"personally surprised and dismayed by how capable current LLMs were at providing critical information related to biological weapons."** He told Semafor: "These things are developing extremely, extremely fast, they're a lot more capable than I thought they would be when it comes to science."

**Key findings:**
- One team member with a postdoctoral fellowship studying a pandemic-capable virus found LLMs could provide "post-doc level knowledge to troubleshoot commonly encountered problems" when working with that virus
- For low-skill users, LLMs could suggest which viruses to acquire
- Although LLMs often hallucinate, they answered almost all questions accurately at least sometimes, and answered some critical questions nearly always accurately
- Gryphon workshops with 20+ biosecurity experts identified concerning misuse scenarios including "how to collapse an ecosystem" and "reconstruct information redacted from sensitive scientific documents"

Despite the concerning findings, Casagrande believes "concerted action could ensure safety is built into the most advanced models."

### Anthropic, OpenAI Evaluations

AI labs have conducted extensive internal evaluations testing whether their models could provide "uplift" to potential bioweapon developers. These evaluations are becoming more sophisticated and more alarming.

**Anthropic's approach:** Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) (RSP) defines AI Safety Levels (ASL) modeled after biosafety level (BSL) standards. They conduct at least 10 different biorisk evaluations for each major model release. In early 2025, Anthropic sent a letter to the White House "urging immediate action on AI security after its testing revealed alarming improvements in Claude 3.7 Sonnet's ability to assist with aspects of bioweapons development."

**OpenAI's framework:** OpenAI's [Preparedness Framework](https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/) categorizes biological and chemical capabilities as "Tracked Categories" requiring ongoing evaluation. They define two thresholds:
- **High capability:** Could "provide meaningful counterfactual assistance to 'novice' actors (anyone with a basic relevant technical background) that enables them to create known biological or chemical threats"
- **Critical capability:** Could "introduce unprecedented new pathways to severe harm"

OpenAI states their most advanced models "aren't yet capable enough to pose severe risks" in biosecurity—but expects upcoming models may reach "high" capability level.

**US/UK AI Safety Institute joint evaluation (2024):** The first joint government-led model evaluation tested Claude 3.5 Sonnet across biological capabilities, cyber capabilities, software development, and safeguard efficacy. Elizabeth Kelly, AISI director, called it "the most comprehensive government-led safety evaluation of an advanced AI model to date."

### Kevin Esvelt's Classroom Experiment

MIT researcher Kevin Esvelt conducted an informal but striking demonstration. He asked students to use ChatGPT or other LLMs to create a dangerous virus. After only **one hour**, the class identified:
- Four potential pandemic pathogens
- How to generate them from synthetic DNA
- Names of DNA synthesis companies unlikely to screen orders
- Detailed protocols and troubleshooting guidance

As Esvelt put it regarding AI's ability to circumvent DNA screening defenses: **"We've built a Maginot Line of defense, and AI just walked around it."**

This demonstration, while not a rigorous study, illustrates how quickly accessible LLMs can be for malicious purposes—even for those without prior expertise.

### CNAS Report: AI and Biological National Security Risks (2024)

The [Center for a New American Security report](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/ai-and-the-evolution-of-biological-national-security-risks) by Bill Drexel and Caleb Withers provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolving AI-biosecurity landscape.

**Key concerns identified:**
- AI could enable bioterrorism, create unprecedented superviruses, and develop novel targeted bioweapons
- AI's potential to "optimize bioweapons for targeted effects, such as pathogens tailored to specific genetic groups or geographies, could significantly shift states' incentives to use biological weapons"
- If realized, such threats could "expose the United States to catastrophic threats far exceeding the impact of COVID-19"

**Key recommendations:**
- Strengthen screening mechanisms for cloud labs and genetic synthesis providers
- Conduct rigorous assessments of foundation models' biological capabilities throughout the bioweapons lifecycle
- Invest in technical safety mechanisms to curb threats posed by foundation models
- Consider a licensing regime for biological design tools with potentially catastrophic capabilities

The report emphasizes that while AI-enabled biological catastrophes are "far from inevitable," current biological safeguards already need significant updates.

## How AI Could Help Attackers

AI could assist at multiple stages of bioweapon development:

### Attack Chain Analysis

A successful biological attack requires success across multiple stages, each with independent failure modes:

| Stage | AI Contribution | Traditional Difficulty | AI Changes What |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Motivation | None | Present | — |
| Information access | High | Moderate | Reduces search time |
| Knowledge uplift | Low-Moderate | High | Bridges expertise gaps |
| Lab access | None | High | — |
| Synthesis | None (currently) | Very High | Future: could guide procedures |
| Deployment | Low | High | Could optimize dispersal |
| Evading countermeasures | Moderate | Variable | Could design novel variants |

See [Bioweapons Attack Chain Model](/knowledge-base/models/bioweapons-attack-chain/) for detailed probability estimates at each stage.

### Specific Assistance Pathways

**Target identification** — AI might help identify dangerous modifications to known pathogens or find novel biological agents. Large language models trained on scientific literature have extensive knowledge of pathogen biology.

**Synthesis planning** — AI could help determine how to create dangerous biological materials. Protein design tools can generate novel sequences, and LLMs can explain synthesis routes.

**Knowledge bridging** — Most concerningly, AI might help bridge knowledge gaps. Historically, bioweapons development required rare combinations of expertise. AI could help a motivated individual or small group compensate for missing knowledge, potentially replacing what previously required teams of specialists.

**Evasion optimization** — AI could help design pathogens or synthesis routes that evade detection by screening tools, surveillance systems, or medical countermeasures.

## History & Current Infrastructure

Biological threats exist on a spectrum. State programs have historically been the main concern, but the barrier to entry may be dropping. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how much damage pathogens can cause and highlighted gaps in biosecurity infrastructure.

### Historical Programs

#### State Bioweapons Programs

Multiple nations have maintained offensive biological weapons programs despite the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC):

| Program | Era | Scale | Outcome |
|---------|-----|-------|---------|
| US | 1943-1969 | Large | Unilaterally terminated by Nixon |
| Soviet Union | 1928-1992 | Massive (30,000-40,000 staff) | Collapsed with USSR; concern about residual capabilities and scientist emigration |
| Japan (Unit 731) | 1937-1945 | Large | Defeated in WWII; perpetrators granted immunity by US in exchange for data |
| Iraq | 1980s-1990s | Moderate | Dismantled after Gulf War; revealed extensive program |
| South Africa | 1981-1993 | Moderate | Dismantled post-apartheid; included ethnic targeting research |

These programs required vast resources, thousands of scientists, and state-level infrastructure. The concern is that AI could reduce these requirements.

**Current compliance concerns:** The 2024 State Department report raised BWC compliance concerns about **China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea**. Verification remains impossible because the BWC has no formal verification regime.

#### The Soviet Biopreparat Program: A Case Study

The Soviet Union operated the world's largest, longest, and most sophisticated biological weapons program—in direct violation of the BWC it had signed in 1972. Understanding this program illuminates both the scale of resources historically required and the ongoing legacy concerns.

**Scale and organization:**
- [Biopreparat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopreparat) was created in April 1974 as a civilian cover organization
- Employed **30,000-40,000 personnel** across 40-50 research facilities
- Included five major military-focused research institutes, numerous design facilities, three pilot plants, and five dual-use production plants
- Annual production capacity for weaponized smallpox alone: **90-100 tons**

**Agents developed:**
- Weaponized smallpox (continued even after WHO declared eradication)
- Anthrax ("Strain 836" created as enhanced "battle strain")
- Plague, Q fever, tularemia, glanders, Marburg hemorrhagic fever
- All agents designed for aerosol dispersal via ballistic or cruise missiles

**The Sverdlovsk incident (1979):** Accidental release of anthrax spores from a military facility killed at least 66 people (true number unknown—KGB destroyed records). The Soviet government blamed contaminated meat until Boris Yeltsin admitted the truth in 1992.

**Key defectors who revealed the program:**
- **Vladimir Pasechnik** (1989): First high-level defector to the UK; his testimony enabled Thatcher and Bush to pressure Gorbachev
- **Ken Alibek** (Kanatjan Alibekov, 1992): First deputy director of Biopreparat; created Russia's first tularemia bomb and enhanced anthrax strains; provided US government with detailed accounting after emigration

**Legacy concerns:**
- Some facilities and scientists absorbed into public health institutions
- US programs attempted to redirect former weapons scientists to peaceful research
- In late 1997, US expanded efforts after detecting "intensified attempts by Iran and other countries of proliferation concern to acquire biological weapons expertise and materials from former Soviet institutes"

**Lesson for AI risk:** Even with massive state resources, Biopreparat required decades and thousands of scientists to develop reliable weapons. This suggests the wet-lab barrier is formidable—but also that determined state actors with existing infrastructure could integrate AI assistance more easily than non-state actors starting from scratch.

#### Non-State Actor Attempts

The historical record of non-state biological attacks reveals consistent technical failures despite significant motivation and resources:

**1984 Oregon Salmonella Attack (Rajneeshees)**
- Religious commune deliberately contaminated salad bars with Salmonella typhimurium
- **751 cases of food poisoning**, 45 hospitalizations, no deaths
- Remains the largest bioterrorist attack in U.S. history
- Used readily available pathogen requiring no sophisticated technology
- **Key insight:** Demonstrated that biological attacks don't require advanced technology, but also that impact was limited without sophisticated delivery

**Aum Shinrikyo (1990s)**
- Japanese cult with **$1 billion in assets**, hundreds of members, PhD scientists
- Attempted anthrax, botulinum toxin, and other biological agents—**all failed**
- Anthrax sprayer deployed in Tokyo produced no casualties (used vaccine strain by mistake)
- Eventually succeeded with sarin chemical attack (13 dead, thousands injured)
- **Key insight:** Even well-funded, technically sophisticated groups with scientific personnel have failed at biological weapons. The wet-lab barrier is real.

**2001 Anthrax Letters (Amerithrax)**
- Letters containing anthrax spores killed 5 people, infected 17 others
- Perpetrator (Bruce Ivins) was a **senior scientist at USAMRIID** with decades of anthrax experience and legitimate access to spores
- Required no acquisition of knowledge—perpetrator was a world expert
- **Key insight:** Insider threat, not information access, enabled this attack. AI wouldn't have helped—the perpetrator already knew everything.

**Why has catastrophic bioterrorism not occurred?**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Technical difficulty | Synthesis, production, and weaponization require tacit knowledge |
| Pathogen handling | Dangerous to the attacker; requires safety infrastructure |
| Delivery challenges | Aerosol dispersion is technically demanding |
| Attribution risk | Genomic analysis increasingly enables source identification |
| Goal mismatch | Most terrorist groups want publicity, not mass extinction |
| Limited access | Dangerous pathogens are controlled; acquisition is difficult |

This historical record could indicate either genuine difficulty (the barriers are high) or luck (we've been fortunate). The precautionary argument is that AI could systematically lower multiple barriers simultaneously, changing the calculus even if each individual barrier remains partially intact.

### Current Biosecurity Infrastructure

DNA synthesis companies already screen orders for dangerous sequences, but screening isn't comprehensive:

| Defense Layer | Coverage | Effectiveness | AI Vulnerability |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| DNA synthesis screening | Major companies | 40-70% (pre-2024); improving | High (evasion design) |
| BSL facility access control | High containment | High | Low |
| Pathogen inventory tracking | Research labs | Moderate | Low |
| Export controls (equipment) | Dual-use items | Moderate | Low |
| Disease surveillance | Advanced countries | Moderate-High | Moderate |
| Medical countermeasures | Known pathogens | Moderate | Moderate (novel agents) |

#### DNA Synthesis Screening: The Critical Chokepoint

DNA synthesis screening is considered the key "chokepoint" in the AI-assisted bioweapons pipeline—if dangerous sequences can be intercepted before synthesis, attacks become much harder. However, significant gaps remain:

**Current limitations:**
- Participation in the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) is voluntary—not all companies are members
- Regulations are inconsistent between countries
- Screening relies on matching against databases of known dangerous sequences—novel variants can evade detection
- High false positive rates require expensive human review
- Benchtop DNA synthesizers are emerging that could bypass commercial screening entirely

**Post-Microsoft patch status:** After Microsoft's research revealed 75%+ evasion rates, a software patch was deployed to synthesis companies worldwide. The fix now catches approximately **97% of threats**—but experts warn "the fix is incomplete" and gaps remain.

**Policy response:** In April 2024, the White House OSTP released a [Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/04/29/framework-for-nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening/), requiring federally funded programs to screen customers and orders, keep records, and report suspicious orders. NIST is partnering with stakeholders to improve screening standards and mitigate AI-specific risks.

#### Emerging Defensive Infrastructure

**SecureDNA:** A [Swiss foundation](https://securedna.org/) providing free, privacy-preserving DNA synthesis screening that already exceeds 2026 regulatory requirements. SecureDNA screens sequences below the 50 base pair length using a "random adversarial threshold" algorithm designed to be more robust against AI-designed evasion.

**Nucleic Acid Observatory (NAO):** A [collaboration between SecureBio and MIT](https://naobservatory.org/) pioneering pathogen-agnostic early warning through deep metagenomic sequencing. Unlike traditional surveillance that looks for known pathogens, NAO aims to detect new and unknown pathogens through wastewater and pooled nasal swab sampling.

**SecureBio's "Delay, Detect, Defend" strategy:** Kevin Esvelt's [SecureBio organization](https://securebio.org/) works on multiple defensive layers:
- **Delay:** Synthesis screening and access controls
- **Detect:** Early warning systems like the NAO
- **Defend:** Societal resilience through germicidal UV light, pandemic-proof PPE stockpiles, and rapid countermeasure development

## Emerging Technologies of Concern

Several emerging technologies could compound AI-enabled biosecurity risks by removing barriers that currently limit attack feasibility:

### Benchtop DNA Synthesizers

A new generation of desktop DNA synthesis devices may enable users to print DNA in their own laboratories, potentially bypassing commercial screening entirely.

**Current products:**
- [Kilobaser](https://kilobaser.com/): Personal DNA/RNA synthesizer, 27x33x33 cm, produces oligos in 30-50 minutes with 2.5 min/base turnaround
- [DNA Script SYNTAX System](https://www.dnascript.com/products/syntax/): Enzymatic DNA synthesis (water-based, avoiding harsh chemicals), 96 parallel oligos up to 120 nucleotides
- [Evonetix Evaleo](https://www.evonetix.com/gene-synthesis): Gene-length DNA synthesis on silicon chips, claiming 10x faster than current technologies
- BioXp (Telesis Bio): Commercial benchtop synthetic biology workstation automating pipetting, mixing, thermal cycling, purification, and storage

**Current limitations:**
- Most benchtop devices limited to sequences under **120 base pairs**—insufficient for most dangerous applications
- Not yet viable alternatives to centralized DNA providers for gene-length sequences
- Quality control and yield often inferior to commercial synthesis

**Biosecurity implications:**
- [NTI analysis](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/benchtop-dna-synthesis-devices-capabilities-biosecurity-implications-and-governance/) notes "three converging technological trends—enzymatic synthesis, hardware automation, and increased demand from computational tools—are likely to drive rapid advancement in benchtop capabilities over the next decade"
- Manufacturers should implement rigorous sequence screening for each fragment produced
- Governments should provide clear regulations for manufacturers to incorporate screening
- Once capabilities exceed current limits, benchtop devices could become a significant biosecurity gap

### Cloud Laboratories

[Cloud laboratories](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA3851-1.html) are heavily automated, centralized research facilities where scientists run experiments remotely from computers. They present unique biosecurity challenges:

**How cloud labs lower barriers:**
- Reduce technical skill requirements by automating complex procedures
- Enable "one-stop-shop" research that could expand the pool of capable actors
- Allow experiments to be performed remotely, potentially bypassing ethical constraints in traditional academic settings
- Researchers retain full control over experimental design without physical presence

**Current governance gaps:**
- No public data on cloud lab operations, workflows, customer numbers, or locations worldwide
- No standardized approaches for customer screening shared between organizations
- Cybersecurity laws don't account for unique vulnerabilities of biological data and lab automation systems
- Biosafety regulations typically neglect digital threats like remote manipulation of synthesis machines

**Proposed solutions ([RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/11/robust-biosecurity-measures-should-be-standardized.html)):**
- Create a Cloud Lab Security Consortium (CLSC) similar to IGSC for DNA synthesis
- Minimum security standards: customer screening, controlled substance access, experiment screening, secured networks
- Human-in-the-loop controls when AI systems place synthesis orders for sequences of concern

### Biological Design Tools (BDTs)

Beyond LLMs, specialized biological design tools present distinct risks:

**[AlphaFold](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/) and protein structure prediction:**
- Revolutionary tool for predicting protein structure from genetic sequence (90%+ accuracy)
- Could enable optimization of existing hazards: increasing toxicity, improving immune evasion, enhancing transmissibility
- Could potentially enable design of completely novel toxins targeting human proteins
- Google DeepMind engaged 50+ domain experts in biosecurity assessment for AlphaFold 3
- Implements experimental refusal mechanisms to block misuse—but biological design often resides in dual-use space

**Other BDT concerns:**
- Machine learning for prediction of host range, transmissibility, and virulence
- Generative models for novel agent design
- Tools that help design sequences evading DNA screening (as demonstrated in Microsoft research)

**Dual-use nature:** Unlike LLM guardrails, where harmful requests are often clearly distinguishable, biological design tool queries are frequently dual-use. The same protein optimization that could enhance a therapeutic could theoretically enhance a toxin. This makes technical controls more difficult than for text-based LLMs.

**Policy recommendations ([UNICRI](https://unicri.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/21_dual_use.pdf)):**
- Prerelease evaluation requirements for advanced biological models regardless of funding source
- Prioritize mitigating risks of pathogens capable of causing major epidemics
- Preserve researcher autonomy while implementing targeted controls on highest-risk capabilities

## Research Governance & International Law

AI-enabled bioweapons risk exists within a broader context of biosecurity challenges, including ongoing debates about research oversight and international governance gaps.

### Gain-of-Function and Enhanced Pandemic Pathogen Research

Gain-of-function (GoF) research—experiments that enhance pathogen transmissibility, virulence, or host range—has become intensely controversial, with implications for AI-biosecurity debates:

**Recent policy developments:**
- **May 2024:** White House OSTP released the "[Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential](https://aspr.hhs.gov/S3/Documents/USG-Policy-for-Oversight-of-DURC-and-PEPP-May2024-508.pdf)" (DURC/PEPP Policy)
- **May 2025:** [Executive order blocked](https://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-nih-suspends-dozens-pathogen-studies-over-gain-function-concerns) the 2024 policy the day before it took effect
- **Ongoing:** NIH identified 40+ projects that may meet definitions of dangerous GoF research and demanded scientists suspend work

**Congressional activity:**
- House approved a ban on federal funding for GoF research modifying risky pathogens
- Scientific groups warn vaguely worded provisions could unintentionally halt flu vaccine development and other beneficial research
- Risky Research Review Act (S. 854, H.R. 1864) would establish a life sciences research security board

**Key limitation:** Both the 2014 DURC Policy and 2024 PEPP Policy only apply to **government-funded research**. Extending coverage to privately funded research would require new regulations or legislation. AI labs developing biological design tools with private funding currently face no equivalent oversight requirements.

**Relevance to AI risk:** The GoF debate previews challenges AI governance will face:
- Distinguishing beneficial from dangerous research is difficult
- Oversight mechanisms are primarily voluntary and apply only to government-funded work
- International coordination is lacking
- Technical definitions ("gain of function," "enhanced pandemic potential") are contested

### The Biological Weapons Convention: Structural Weaknesses

The [Biological Weapons Convention](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/biological-weapons-convention-bwc-glance-0) (BWC), signed in 1972, prohibits development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. It has 187 states parties—but significant structural weaknesses:

**No verification regime:**
- Unlike chemical and nuclear weapons agreements, the BWC contains **no formal verification provisions**
- Attempts to develop a verification protocol failed in 2001 after years of negotiation
- Governments have not discussed verification within the treaty framework for over two decades

**Minimal institutional support:**
- The BWC has only **four staff members**
- Budget is smaller than an average McDonald's restaurant (per Toby Ord)
- Compare to: IAEA has 2,500+ staff; OPCW has 500+ staff

**Recent developments:**
- December 2022: States Parties established a Working Group on strengthening the Convention
- 2024: Fourth and fifth Working Group sessions held (August, December)
- December 2024: Fifth session "ended with a regrettable conclusion in which a single States Party undermined the noteworthy progress achieved"—[setback reported](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/2025/01/16/derailment-of-the-fifth-working-group-of-the-biological-and-toxin-weapons-convention/) by Council on Strategic Risks
- Working Group has only **seven days** through end of 2025 for verification discussion

**Practical limitations:**
- No politically palatable, technologically feasible, and financially sustainable system can guarantee detection of all biological weapons
- Rapid advances in biotechnology create new verification challenges
- AI capabilities could make verification even more difficult by enabling novel agent design

**What's possible:** While perfect verification is unachievable, the [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists argues](https://thebulletin.org/2024/03/how-the-biological-weapons-convention-could-verify-treaty-compliance/) that "measures in combination could generate considerably greater confidence in compliance by BWC states parties."

## Defensive Technologies and Pandemic Preparedness

The same technological advances that could enable attacks also offer powerful defensive capabilities. Many experts believe defense will ultimately win the offense-defense balance—the question is whether we're in a dangerous transition period.

### mRNA Vaccine Platforms

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the transformative potential of mRNA vaccines for rapid response:

**Speed advantages:**
- Traditional vaccines require time-consuming manufacturing with live pathogens
- mRNA vaccines can be **designed in days** once genetic sequence is known
- COVID-19 mRNA vaccines received FDA EUA in under one year—unprecedented speed
- CEPI's "100 Days Mission" aims to develop safe, effective vaccines against new threats in just 100 days

**Manufacturing advantages:**
- Cell-free manufacture enables accelerated, scalable production
- Standardizable processes require minimal facility adaptations between products
- Smaller manufacturing footprints than traditional vaccines
- Same facility can produce multiple vaccine products

**Safety profile:**
- mRNA does not enter cell nucleus—cannot integrate into cellular genome
- Can be administered repeatedly (no anti-vector immunity like with viral vectors)
- Avoids live pathogen handling in manufacturing

**Pandemic preparedness implications:**
- Platform is "pathogen-agnostic"—same technology works against any target with known sequence
- BARDA and CEPI supporting development of 50+ vaccine candidates against high-risk pathogens
- [Next-generation "trans-amplifying" mRNA vaccines](https://cepi.net/new-research-investigate-next-generation-trans-amplifying-mrna-vaccines) under development could provide stronger immune responses

**For AI-bioweapons specifically:** Rapid vaccine development could limit the damage from engineered pathogens if they're detected early. However, novel agents designed to evade detection or existing countermeasures would still pose severe risks during the response window.

### Metagenomic Surveillance

Traditional disease surveillance looks for known pathogens. Metagenomic sequencing offers **pathogen-agnostic** detection:

**How it works:**
- Deep sequencing of all genetic material in samples (wastewater, nasal swabs, etc.)
- Computational analysis identifies viral, bacterial, and other sequences
- Can detect novel or unexpected pathogens that wouldn't be caught by targeted testing

**Current research:**
- [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://naobservatory.org/): Sequencing wastewater from major US airports and treatment plants
- Recent dataset: 13.1 terabases from 20 wastewater samples at LA Hyperion plant (serving 4 million residents)
- [Lancet Microbe publication](https://naobservatory.org/blog/lancet-paper/) establishing sensitivity models for W-MGS detection

**Sensitivity and cost tradeoffs:**
- Untargeted shotgun sequencing less sensitive than targeted methods for known pathogens
- Hybridization capture panels greatly increase sensitivity for viruses in the panel but may reduce sensitivity to unknown pathogens
- Large variation in viral detection based on sewershed hydrology and laboratory protocols
- Sensitivity of 1 infected person among 257-2,250 for certain bacterial pathogens

**For AI-bioweapons specifically:** Metagenomic surveillance could provide early warning for engineered pathogens that evade targeted detection. However, sensitivity limits mean outbreaks may need to reach significant scale before detection occurs.

### Far-UVC Germicidal Light

[Far-UVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-UVC) (200-235 nm wavelength) is emerging as a potentially transformative technology for airborne pathogen inactivation in occupied spaces:

**Why it's different from conventional UV:**
- Conventional germicidal UV-C (254 nm) harms human skin and eyes—limited to upper-room use or unoccupied spaces
- Far-UVC (typically 222 nm) is **absorbed in the outer dead layer of skin** and tear layer of eyes—cannot penetrate to living tissue
- Enables direct disinfection of breathing zone while people are present

**Efficacy:**
- Very low dose (2 mJ/cm²) of 222-nm light inactivates >95% of airborne H1N1 virus
- Single far-UVC fixture delivers **33-66 equivalent air changes per hour** for pathogen removal
- Tested effective against tuberculosis, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, murine norovirus (99.8% reduction)
- 2025 review: "high ability" to kill pathogens with "high level of safety"

**Applications for pandemic preparedness:**
- Installation in hospitals, schools, airports, public transit could dramatically reduce airborne transmission
- [Blueprint Biosecurity](https://blueprintbiosecurity.org/building-the-evidence-base-for-far-uvc/) funding research teams to evaluate deployment in real-world scenarios
- Open Philanthropy issued [RFI on far-UVC evaluation](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/request-for-information-evaluation-of-germicidal-far-uvc-safety-efficacy-technology-and-adoption/)
- NIST collaborating with industry on standards development

**Remaining questions:**
- Long-term exposure effects require further research
- Real-world efficacy in varied building environments not fully characterized
- Cost and feasibility of widespread deployment

**For AI-bioweapons specifically:** Far-UVC could provide a layer of defense against aerosol-dispersed biological agents in public spaces. Even if attackers successfully synthesize and deploy pathogens, widespread far-UVC installation could limit transmission and buy time for medical response.

---

## Mitigations

### Model-Level Interventions

**Refusals and filtering** — Training models not to help with bioweapon development and filtering dangerous outputs. But these are imperfect—models can be jailbroken, fine-tuned, or open-source models may lack restrictions entirely.

**Effectiveness assessment:**
- Reduces casual misuse
- Raises barrier for unsophisticated actors
- Does not prevent determined actors with technical skills
- Cannot address open-source model proliferation

**Evaluations before deployment** — Testing models for biosecurity risks during development, as part of responsible scaling policies. Useful but relies on labs' good faith and competence.

### AI-Specific Governance

**Compute governance** — Limiting who can train powerful models reduces the availability of capable models to bad actors. Information security around model weights becomes important if models can provide meaningful uplift.

**Biological capability thresholds** — Anthropic's RSP and similar frameworks establish biological capability as a key threshold for enhanced safety measures. This creates systematic evaluation requirements.

**Open-source restrictions** — Limiting the release of model weights for systems with significant biological knowledge. Controversial due to benefits of open research.

### Broader Biosecurity Measures

Broader biosecurity measures may matter more than AI-specific interventions:

| Intervention | Cost | Risk Reduction | Priority |
|--------------|------|----------------|----------|
| DNA synthesis screening | ~$100M/year | 5-15% | High |
| Metagenomic surveillance | ~$500M/year | 15-25% | Very High |
| BSL facility security | ~$200M/year | 5-10% | High |
| Pandemic response stockpiles | ~$2B/year | 10-20% | Medium-High |
| International verification | ~$300M/year | 3-8% | Medium |

**DNA synthesis screening** — Flagging dangerous sequences before synthesis. The primary defense but has significant gaps that AI can exploit.

**Laboratory access controls** — Restricting who can work with dangerous pathogens. Effective for legitimate facilities; doesn't address improvised labs.

**Disease surveillance** — Early detection of outbreaks. Benefits from AI advances and may be where AI provides greatest defensive value.

**Medical countermeasures** — Rapid vaccine and treatment development. mRNA platforms demonstrated during COVID-19 show how quickly responses can be developed.

## Expert Perspectives

Expert opinion on AI-bioweapons risk is divided, with prominent voices on both sides:

### Those More Concerned

**Kevin Esvelt (MIT):** One of the most vocal experts on AI-biosecurity risks. Esvelt emphasizes that if you ask a chatbot how to cause a pandemic, "it will suggest the 1918 influenza virus. It will even tell you where to find the gene sequences online and where to purchase the genetic components." He co-founded SecureDNA and SecureBio to address these risks.

**Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO):** In July 2023, stated there was a "substantial risk" that within 2-3 years, AI would "greatly widen the range of actors with the technical capability to conduct a large-scale biological attack."

**Rocco Casagrande (Gryphon Scientific):** After red-teaming Claude, said he was "personally surprised and dismayed by how capable current LLMs were" and that "these things are developing extremely, extremely fast."

**Toby Ord (Oxford):** Estimates engineered pandemic risk at 1 in 30 by 2100—second highest anthropogenic existential risk after AI itself.

**Bill Drexel and Caleb Withers (CNAS):** Their August 2024 report warns AI could enable "catastrophic threats far exceeding the impact of COVID-19."

### Those More Skeptical

**RAND researchers (Mouton, Lucas, Guest):** Their 2024 study found "no statistically significant difference" between AI-assisted and non-AI groups in bioweapon planning capability. This is the strongest empirical evidence against immediate AI uplift concerns.

**Some biosecurity practitioners:** Emphasize that the wet lab bottleneck—tacit knowledge, equipment access, technique—remains the primary barrier, and AI cannot transfer hands-on skills.

**Information abundance argument:** Dangerous information is already accessible through scientific literature and the internet. AI may provide convenience but not fundamentally new capabilities.

### The Disagreement Structure

The debate often reduces to different assessments of:

| Question | Higher Concern View | Lower Concern View |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Current uplift | Gryphon findings are alarming | RAND study is more rigorous |
| Future trajectory | Capabilities advancing rapidly | May plateau; defenses improving |
| Key bottleneck | Knowledge is underestimated | Wet lab skills remain rate-limiting |
| Guardrail effectiveness | Easy to circumvent; open-source proliferating | Raise meaningful barriers |
| Risk tolerance | Tail risks demand precaution | Base rates suggest low probability |

**Notably:** Even those who downplay current uplift often acknowledge that future models may pose greater risks, and that defensive investments are worthwhile regardless.

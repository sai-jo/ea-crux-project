## Overview

Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media—typically video or audio—that realistically depict people saying or doing things they never did. The technology has evolved from obviously artificial content in 2017 to nearly indistinguishable synthetic media by 2024, creating both direct harms through fraud and harassment and systemic harms by eroding trust in authentic evidence.

High-profile fraud cases demonstrate the financial risks: a $25.6 million theft at [Arup Hong Kong](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html) involved an entire video conference of deepfaked executives, while a $35 million case used voice cloning to impersonate company directors. Beyond individual crimes, deepfakes create a "liar's dividend" where authentic evidence becomes deniable, threatening democratic discourse and justice systems.

| Political Manipulation | Low but growing | Election interference | [Reuters Institute](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/) |
| Evidence Denial | Emerging | Widespread doubt | Academic studies |

## Risk Assessment

| Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Timeline | Trend |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Financial Fraud | High | Very High | Current | Increasing |
| Harassment Campaigns | High | High | Current | Stable |
| Political Disinformation | Medium-High | Medium | 2-3 years | Increasing |
| Evidence Erosion | Very High | High | 3-5 years | Accelerating |

## Technical Capabilities & Development

### Current Generation Quality

| Capability | 2017 | 2024 | Evidence |
|------------|------|------|---------|
| Face Swapping | Obvious artifacts | Near-perfect quality | [FaceSwap benchmarks](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) |
| Voice Cloning | Minutes of training data | 3-10 seconds needed | [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), [Microsoft VALL-E](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vall-e-x/) |
| Real-time Generation | Impossible | Live video calls | [DeepFaceLive](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLive) |
| Detection Resistance | Easily caught | Specialized tools required | [DFDC Challenge results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07397) |

### Key Technical Advances

**Real-time Generation**: Modern deepfake tools can generate synthetic faces during live video calls, enabling new forms of impersonation fraud. [DeepFaceLive](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLive) and similar tools require only consumer-grade GPUs.

**Few-shot Voice Cloning**: Services like [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) can clone voices from seconds of audio. [Microsoft's VALL-E](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vall-e-x/) demonstrates even more sophisticated capabilities.

**Adversarial Training**: Modern generators specifically train to evade detection systems, creating an arms race where detection lags behind generation quality.

## Categories of Harm & Impact

### Financial Fraud

| Case | Amount | Method | Year | Source |
|------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| Arup Hong Kong | $25.6M | Video conference deepfakes | 2024 | [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html) |
| Hong Kong Company | $35M | Voice cloning | 2020 | [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/a-voice-deepfake-was-used-to-scam-a-ceo-out-of-243000/) |
| WPP (Attempted) | Unknown | Multi-platform approach | 2024 | [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68890621) |
| Elderly Crypto Scam | $690K | Elon Musk impersonation | 2024 | [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/deepfake-elon-musk-used-scam-elderly-man-690000-rcna173429) |

**Emerging Patterns**:
- Multi-platform attacks combining voice, video, and messaging
- Targeting of elderly populations with celebrity impersonations
- Corporate fraud using executive impersonation
- Real-time video call deception

### Non-consensual Intimate Imagery

[Sensity AI research](https://sensity.ai/reports/) found that 90-95% of deepfake videos online are non-consensual intimate imagery, primarily targeting women. This creates:

- Psychological trauma and reputational harm
- Economic impacts through career damage
- Chilling effects on public participation
- Disproportionate gender-based violence

### Political Manipulation & The Liar's Dividend

Beyond creating false content, deepfakes enable the "liar's dividend"—authentic evidence becomes deniable. Political examples include:

- [Politicians claiming real recordings are deepfakes](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-politicians-deepfake-claims-idUSKBN2402S5)
- Pre-emptive deepfake denials before scandals break
- Erosion of shared epistemic foundations

- Provenance systems bypass detection entirely
- Increasing computational resources for detection

**Arguments Against**:
- Adversarial training specifically defeats detectors
- Perfect generation may be mathematically achievable
- Economic incentives favor generation over detection

### Content Authentication Adoption

**Critical Questions**:
- Will C2PA achieve sufficient market penetration?
- Can authentication survive sophisticated circumvention attempts?
- How to handle legacy content without provenance?

**Adoption Challenges**:
| Factor | Challenge | Potential Solutions |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| User Experience | Complex workflows | Transparent integration |
| Privacy Concerns | Metadata tracking | Privacy-preserving proofs |
| Legacy Content | No retroactive protection | Gradual transition |
| Circumvention | Technical workarounds | Legal enforcement |

### Societal Impact Thresholds

**Key Questions**:
- At what point does evidence denial become socially catastrophic?
- How much fraud loss is economically sustainable?
- Can democratic discourse survive widespread authenticity doubt?

Research suggests [epistemic collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/epistemic-collapse/) may occur when public confidence in authentic evidence drops below ~30%, though this threshold remains uncertain.

## Intervention Landscape

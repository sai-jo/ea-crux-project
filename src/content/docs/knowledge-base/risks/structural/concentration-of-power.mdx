## Overview

AI is enabling unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of a few organizations, fundamentally altering traditional power structures across economic, political, and military domains. Unlike previous technologies that affected specific sectors, AI's general-purpose nature creates advantages that **compound across all areas of human activity**.

> **For comprehensive analysis**, see [AI Control Concentration](/knowledge-base/parameters/ai-control-concentration/), which covers:
> - Current power distribution metrics across actors
> - Concentration mechanisms (compute, data, talent, capital)
> - Factors that increase and decrease concentration
> - Intervention effectiveness and policy options
> - Trajectory scenarios through 2035

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Current Status | 5-10 Year Likelihood | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Economic concentration** | 5 firms control 80%+ AI cloud | Very High (85%+) | Extreme |
| **Compute barriers** | \$100M+ for frontier training | Very High (90%+) | High |
| **Talent concentration** | Top 50 researchers at 6 labs | High (75%) | High |
| **Regulatory capture risk** | Early lobbying influence | High (70%) | High |
| **Geopolitical concentration** | US-China duopoly emerging | Very High (90%+) | Extreme |

## Key Concentration Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Current State | Barrier Effect |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Compute requirements** | <R id="dfeb27439fd01d3e">\$100M+, 25,000+ GPUs for frontier models</R> | Only ~20 organizations can train frontier models |
| **Cloud infrastructure** | <R id="ee877771092e5530">AWS, Azure, GCP control 68%</R> | Essential gatekeepers for AI development |
| **Chip manufacturing** | <R id="31ee49c7212810bb">NVIDIA 95%+ market share</R> | Critical chokepoint |
| **Capital requirements** | <R id="68ad9c52735cc630">Microsoft \$13B+ into OpenAI</R> | Only largest tech firms can compete |
| **2030 projection** | <R id="5fa46de681ff9902">\$1-10B per model</R> | Likely fewer than 10 organizations capable |

## Why Concentration Matters for AI Safety

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Democratic accountability** | Small groups make decisions affecting billions without representation |
| **Single points of failure** | Concentration creates systemic risk if key actors fail |
| **Regulatory capture** | Concentrated interests shape rules in their favor |
| **Values alignment** | Whose values get embedded when few control development? |
| **Geopolitical instability** | AI advantage could upset international balance |

## Responses That Address This Risk

| Response | Mechanism | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| [Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) | Control access to training resources | Emerging |
| Antitrust enforcement | Break up concentrated power | Limited application |
| Open-source AI | Distribute capabilities broadly | Active but contested |
| International coordination | Prevent winner-take-all dynamics | Early stage |

See [AI Control Concentration](/knowledge-base/parameters/ai-control-concentration/) for detailed analysis.

## Overview

AI could automate large portions of the economy faster than workers can adapt, creating mass unemployment, inequality, and social instability. While technological unemployment fears have historically been unfounded, AI may be different in scope—potentially affecting cognitive work that previous automation couldn't touch.

> **For comprehensive analysis**, see [Economic Stability](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/economic-stability/), which covers:
> - Current state assessment with displacement metrics by sector
> - Factors that increase and decrease economic stability
> - Adaptation mechanisms and their effectiveness
> - Policy responses (labor transition, compute governance)
> - Trajectory scenarios through 2035

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Severity** | Moderate to High | Mass unemployment could trigger social instability |
| **Likelihood** | High | <R id="d70245053c0a284b">IMF estimates 40%</R> of global jobs exposed; <R id="61d3845eeda8e42f">WEF projects</R> 92M displaced by 2030 |
| **Timeline** | Near to Medium-term | Displacement observable now in tech; broader impacts 2025-2030 |
| **Trend** | Increasing | <R id="417f66880659ef93">McKinsey finds 57%</R> of US work hours technically automatable |
| **Adaptation Window** | Uncertain | Historical transitions took decades; AI advancing yearly |

## Impact by Sector

| Sector | Jobs at High Risk | Timeline | Source |
|--------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| **Customer Service** | 80% | 2025-2027 | <R id="b225f5c7be1c9237">Gartner</R> |
| **Data Entry** | 69-95% | 2024-2027 | <R id="506fe97dbcf61068">McKinsey</R> |
| **Content Writing** | 50-57% | 2025-2030 | <R id="8e0598df720ecae1">DemandSage</R> |
| **Administrative** | 40-60% | 2025-2030 | <R id="76b2231bb5b520c3">WEF 2025</R> |
| **Financial Services** | 25-35% | 2026-2032 | <R id="87e546ba6b7733b7">Goldman Sachs</R> |

Pattern: Jobs involving structured, repetitive cognitive tasks face highest near-term risk; roles requiring physical presence, complex judgment, or relationship management remain more protected.

## Key Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Gradual Adaptation** | 35-45% | Manageable transition; 5-15% temporary displacement |
| **Rapid Displacement** | 25-35% | Persistent 15-25% unemployment; social instability |
| **Extreme Inequality** | 10-20% | Small elite captures most value; large population marginalized |
| **Post-Scarcity** | 5-15% | Material abundance; employment becomes optional |

<R id="d70245053c0a284b">IMF</R> explicitly warns: "in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality."

## Responses That Address This Risk

| Response | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| [Labor Transition Support](/knowledge-base/responses/resilience/labor-transition/) | Retraining, safety nets, job creation | Medium |
| [Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) | Slow deployment to allow adaptation | Medium |
| New ownership models | Distribute AI ownership broadly | Untested |
| Universal basic income | Decouple income from employment | Proposed |

See [Economic Stability](/knowledge-base/ai-transition-model/factors/transition-turbulence/economic-stability/) for detailed analysis.

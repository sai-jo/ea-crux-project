## Overview

Human agency—the capacity to make meaningful choices that shape one's life—faces systematic erosion as AI systems increasingly mediate, predict, and direct human behavior. Unlike capability loss, erosion of agency concerns losing **meaningful control even while retaining technical capabilities**.

> **For comprehensive analysis**, see [Human Agency](/knowledge-base/parameters/human-agency/), which covers:
> - Five dimensions of agency (information access, cognitive capacity, meaningful alternatives, accountability, exit options)
> - Agency benchmarks by domain (information, employment, finance, politics, relationships)
> - Factors that increase and decrease agency
> - Measurement approaches and current state assessment
> - Trajectory scenarios through 2035

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Threatens democratic governance foundations |
| **Likelihood** | Medium-High | Already observable in social media, expanding to more domains |
| **Timeline** | 2-10 years | Critical mass of life domains affected |
| **Trend** | Accelerating | Increasing AI deployment in decision systems |
| **Reversibility** | Low | Network effects create strong lock-in |

## Current Manifestations

| Domain | Users/Scale | Agency Impact | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **YouTube** | 2.7B users | Recommendations drive 70% of watch time | <R id="38e7a88003771a68">Google Transparency Report</R> |
| **Social media** | 4B+ users | 13.5% of teen girls report worsened body image from Instagram | <R id="8859336fc6744670">WSJ Facebook Files</R> |
| **Criminal justice** | 1M+ defendants/year | COMPAS affects sentencing with documented racial bias | <R id="81813c9c33253098">ProPublica</R> |
| **Employment** | 75% of large companies | Automated screening with hidden criteria | <R id="264c7d949adbc0b4">Reuters</R> |
| **Consumer credit** | \$1.4T annually | Algorithmic lending with persistent discrimination | <R id="37e7f0ef0fe13f13">Berkeley researchers</R> |

## Key Erosion Mechanisms

### Information Asymmetry

| AI System Knowledge | Human Knowledge | Impact |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Complete behavioral history | Limited self-awareness | Predictable manipulation |
| Real-time biometric data | Delayed emotional recognition | Micro-targeted influence |
| Social network analysis | Individual perspective | Coordinated shaping |
| Predictive modeling | Retrospective analysis | Anticipatory control |

### The Illusion of Enhanced Agency

<R id="f4b3e0b4a17b1b67">MIT research</R> found 67% of participants believed AI assistance *increased* their autonomy, even when objective measures showed reduced decision-making authority. People confuse expanded options with meaningful choice.

## Democratic Implications

| Democratic Requirement | AI Impact | Evidence |
|----------------------|-----------|----------|
| Informed deliberation | Filter bubble creation | <R id="d48e139fc6c16feb">Pariser 2011</R> |
| Autonomous preferences | Preference manipulation | <R id="fefa5213cfba8b45">Susser et al.</R> |
| Equal participation | Algorithmic amplification bias | <R id="5ae5978f266a12c5">Noble 2018</R> |
| Accountable representation | Opaque influence systems | <R id="59f27574afba1d59">Pasquale 2015</R> |

**Voter manipulation**: <R id="8ae54fc1a20f9587">Cambridge Analytica</R> demonstrated 3-5% vote share changes achievable through personalized political ads affecting 87 million users.

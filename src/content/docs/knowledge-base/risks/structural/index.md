Structural risks emerge from how AI development and deployment reshape society, institutions, and power dynamics. These aren't about individual AI systems failing—they're about the broader trajectory of AI development.

## Power & Control

Risks from AI concentrating or enabling power:

- [Concentration of Power](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/concentration-of-power) - AI enabling unprecedented power accumulation
- [Lock-in](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/lock-in) - Permanent entrenchment of values or systems
- [Winner-Take-All](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/winner-take-all) - Extreme inequality from AI advantages

## Competition & Coordination

Risks from how actors interact:

- [Racing Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics) - Competition driving unsafe practices
- [Multipolar Trap](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/multipolar-trap) - Competitive dynamics producing collectively bad outcomes
- [Proliferation](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/proliferation) - Spread of dangerous capabilities

## Human Agency & Society

Risks to human autonomy and capability:

- [Erosion of Human Agency](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/erosion-of-agency) - Humans losing meaningful control over their lives
- [Enfeeblement](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/enfeeblement) - Humanity losing capability to function without AI
- [Economic Disruption](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/economic-disruption) - Mass displacement without adequate transition

## Systemic Instability

Risks from AI-enabled instability:

- [Flash Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/flash-dynamics) - AI systems interacting faster than human oversight
- [Irreversibility](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/irreversibility) - Crossing points of no return

## What Makes These "Structural"

These risks arise from:

1. **Incentive structures** - How competition shapes behavior
2. **Power dynamics** - How AI shifts who controls what
3. **Collective action problems** - Individual rationality producing collective harm
4. **Path dependence** - Early decisions constraining future options

Even if each AI system worked perfectly as intended, structural risks could still materialize. The problem isn't individual failures—it's the overall trajectory.

## Relationship to Other Risks

Structural risks amplify other categories:
- Racing dynamics make accident risks more likely
- Concentration of power makes misuse risks more severe
- Lock-in makes all risks harder to correct

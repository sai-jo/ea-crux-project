title: International Coordination
description: Global cooperation on AI safety and governance.
---

**The approach**: Develop international cooperation mechanisms to ensure AI is developed safely worldwide—especially US-China coordination.

## Evaluation Summary

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Low | Geopolitical headwinds |
| If alignment hard | High | May be necessary for safety |
| If alignment easy | Medium | Still helps with deployment |
| Neglectedness | Medium | Growing attention, limited progress |

## Why International Matters

- AI development is global (US, China, UK, others)
- Unilateral safety is limited (race dynamics)
- Catastrophic AI affects everyone
- Need coordination on standards, research, restrictions

## Current Efforts

| Initiative | Status | Effectiveness |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| AI Safety Summits | Ongoing | Symbolic, limited substance |
| AI Safety Institute network | Growing | Too early to tell |
| Bilateral dialogues | Emerging | Limited trust |
| Export controls | Implemented | May backfire |

## Crux 1: Is US-China Cooperation Possible?

| Possible | Not possible |
|----------|--------------|
| Mutual interest in avoiding catastrophe | Strategic competition too intense |
| Technical cooperation precedent | AI is zero-sum in their view |
| China engaging on safety | Engagement is superficial |

## Crux 2: What Form of Coordination?

| Cooperation type | Feasibility |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Full partnership | Very low |
| Information sharing | Medium |
| Safety standards | Medium |
| Capability restrictions | Low |
| Crisis communication | Medium |

## Crux 3: Do We Want Coordination?

| Coordination good | Coordination risky |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Prevents race to bottom | Legitimizes authoritarian AI |
| Shares safety knowledge | Shares capabilities |
| Reduces misunderstanding | Creates dependency |

**Tension**: Cooperation requires trust; building trust requires cooperation.

## Who Should Work on This?

**Good fit if you believe**:
- International dynamics are crucial
- Diplomacy can make progress
- Long-term relationship building matters
- Geopolitical/China expertise

**Less relevant if you believe**:
- Coordination is impossible
- Domestic progress is sufficient
- Technical alignment is bottleneck

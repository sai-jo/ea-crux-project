title: Pause Advocacy
description: Advocating for slowing or pausing frontier AI development.
---

**The approach**: Advocate for slowing down or pausing the development of frontier AI systems until safety can be ensured.

## Evaluation Summary

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Low | Major political/economic barriers |
| If alignment hard | High | May be necessary |
| If alignment easy | Low | Probably not needed |
| Neglectedness | Medium | Vocal advocates, limited political traction |

## The Case for Pause

- **Risk outpaces safety**: Capabilities advancing faster than alignment
- **Buy time**: More time = more safety research
- **Coordination**: Easier to govern if development slows
- **Precaution**: Don't deploy what we can't control

## Types of "Pause"

| Type | Description | Feasibility |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Full stop | No frontier AI development | Very low |
| Capability limits | Cap at current level | Low |
| Compute limits | Restrict training runs over X FLOP | Medium |
| Conditional pause | Pause until safety criteria met | Medium |
| Slowdown | Reduce speed without stopping | Medium |

## Crux 1: Is Pause Feasible?

| Feasible | Not feasible |
|----------|--------------|
| Small number of actors | Competitive pressure too strong |
| Physical chokepoints (compute) | Development goes underground |
| Historical precedent | No precedent for knowledge |
| Growing political will | Industry opposition too strong |

## Crux 2: Is Pause Desirable?

| Desirable | Undesirable |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reduces risk | Delays beneficial AI |
| Enables better preparation | Creates compute overhang |
| Allows governance catch-up | Cedes leadership to bad actors |

## Crux 3: Who Benefits from Pause?

| Pause is neutral | Pause has distributive effects |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Everyone benefits from safety | Incumbents benefit from reduced competition |
| Global benefit | Geopolitical advantage to non-pausers |
| Future generations benefit | Current generation bears costs |

## Who Should Work on This?

**Good fit if you believe**:
- Alignment is hard and we need time
- Political change is possible
- Other approaches won't work in time
- Willing to take unpopular stance

**Less relevant if you believe**:
- Pause is politically impossible
- Would backfire (compute overhang, etc.)
- Technical alignment is achievable in time

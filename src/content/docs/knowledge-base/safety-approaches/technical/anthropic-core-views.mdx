## Overview

Anthropic's Core Views on AI Safety is their publicly stated research agenda and organizational philosophy. Published in 2023, it articulates why Anthropic believes safety-focused labs should be at the frontier of AI development.

## Key Claims

### 1. Transformative AI is Likely Coming Soon
Anthropic believes advanced AI systems that could have transformative (positive or negative) impacts on the world may be developed in the near future—potentially within the next decade.

### 2. Safety Research Requires Frontier Access
Working with the most capable systems is necessary to:
- Understand risks that only emerge at scale
- Develop safety techniques that work for advanced AI
- Have credibility and influence in the field

### 3. Empirical Alignment Research is Tractable
Unlike some theoretical approaches, Anthropic believes we can make meaningful progress through:
- Studying actual model behavior
- Developing interpretability tools
- Testing alignment techniques empirically

### 4. Being at the Frontier is Necessary for Safety
This is the most controversial claim: Anthropic argues that safety-focused organizations need to be competitive at the frontier, because:
- Safety research on toy models may not transfer
- If safety-focused labs fall behind, less safety-conscious actors dominate
- Influence over deployment requires technical credibility

## Research Priorities

### Constitutional AI
Training models to follow principles rather than just human feedback. Uses model self-critique against a "constitution" of rules.

### Mechanistic Interpretability
Understanding what happens inside neural networks by reverse-engineering their computations. Led by Chris Olah.

### Scalable Oversight
Developing techniques for humans to supervise AI systems on tasks too complex for humans to evaluate directly.

### Responsible Scaling
Framework (RSP) for making capability advancement conditional on safety measures.

## Critiques

### "Racing to the Top" Concerns
Critics argue that even well-intentioned capability development:
- Accelerates timelines for everyone
- Normalizes frontier development race
- May not achieve claimed safety benefits

### Self-Serving Interpretation
Some view Core Views as post-hoc justification for commercial AI development, noting:
- Most staff work on capabilities, not safety
- Commercial pressures may override safety
- "Needs frontier access" is a convenient conclusion

### Alternative Strategies
Other approaches that conflict with Core Views:
- **Pause advocacy**: Stop frontier development entirely
- **Pure safety research**: Work on theory without building systems
- **Governance focus**: Prioritize policy over technical research

## Crux: Does Safety Need Frontier?

| Frontier needed | Frontier not needed |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Emergent risks only appear at scale | Theoretical work can anticipate risks |
| Interpretability needs real models | Toy models can reveal principles |
| Influence requires being competitive | Influence comes from being right |
| Safety techniques must work at scale | Techniques can be developed separately |

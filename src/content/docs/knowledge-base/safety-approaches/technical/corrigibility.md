title: Corrigibility Research
description: Designing AI systems that accept human correction.
---

**The approach**: Create AI systems that actively support human oversight—that want to be corrected, allow modification, and don't resist shutdown.

## Evaluation Summary

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Low | Conceptual and technical challenges |
| If alignment hard | High | Could be key safety property |
| If alignment easy | Low | May not be needed |
| Neglectedness | High | Limited focused research |

## What Corrigibility Means

A corrigible AI would:
- Shut down when asked
- Allow modification of its goals
- Not manipulate operators
- Actively assist with its own correction
- Maintain these properties under self-modification

## Why It's Hard

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Incentive incompatibility** | Goal-directed agents have reason to resist modification |
| **Utility function problem** | Hard to specify "defer to humans" formally |
| **Self-modification** | Must preserve corrigibility through changes |
| **Subagent problem** | Must create corrigible subagents |

## Crux 1: Is Corrigibility Coherent?

| Coherent | Not coherent |
|----------|--------------|
| Can formally define | Leads to paradoxes |
| Balance is possible | Inherent tension with goals |
| Indifference approaches work | Indifference has problems |

**Theoretical question**: Can an AI genuinely be indifferent to modification without being useless?

## Crux 2: Is It Achievable?

| Achievable | Not achievable |
|------------|----------------|
| Training can instill it | Instrumental convergence too strong |
| Architecture can enforce it | Capable AI finds loopholes |
| Demonstrated in current systems | Won't scale with capability |

## Crux 3: Is It Sufficient?

| Sufficient for safety | Not sufficient |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Control solves alignment | Need alignment + corrigibility |
| Can correct any problem | Some harms aren't correctable |
| Buys time for alignment | Doesn't solve underlying problem |

## Who Should Work on This?

**Good fit if you believe**:
- Control is possible and important
- Theoretical foundations matter
- Corrigibility is a key safety property
- Mathematical/formal methods skills

**Less relevant if you believe**:
- Alignment is sufficient
- Control is impossible at high capability
- Need practical approaches first

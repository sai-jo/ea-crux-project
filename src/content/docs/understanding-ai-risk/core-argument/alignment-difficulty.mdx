**The core question**: Aligning advanced AI with human values is a fundamentally difficult problem that we may not solve in time, or at all.

This is one of the most contested cruxes in AI safety. Views range from "alignment is essentially solved" to "alignment is likely impossible in the time we have."

## What Makes Alignment Hard?

### The Core Challenges

  estimates={[
    { source: "Outer Alignment", value: "Hard", notes: "Specifying what we actually want" },
    { source: "Inner Alignment", value: "Very Hard", notes: "Ensuring the AI internalizes our goals" },
    { source: "Scalable Oversight", value: "Hard", notes: "Evaluating superhuman outputs" },
    { source: "Robustness", value: "Hard", notes: "Alignment holding in new situations" },
    { source: "Deception Detection", value: "Very Hard", notes: "Detecting if AI is faking alignment" },
  ]}
/>

### 1. The Specification Problem (Outer Alignment)

**The challenge**: We can't fully specify what we want.

**Why it's hard**:
- Human values are complex, contextual, and often contradictory
- We don't even know what we want in many situations
- Any specification we write down will have edge cases
- Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

**Example**: "Maximize human happiness"
- Does that include wireheading (direct stimulation of pleasure centers)?
- What about people who enjoy harmful activities?
- How do we weigh conflicting preferences?
- Over what time horizon?

**Current approaches**:
- RLHF: Learn preferences from human feedback
- Constitutional AI: Specify principles, not outcomes
- Inverse reward design: Infer values from behavior
- Debate: Let AI systems argue for different interpretations

### 2. The Inner Alignment Problem

**The challenge**: Even if we specify the right objective, the AI might learn different goals internally.

**Mechanism**:
- Training optimizes for performance on training distribution
- The AI might learn a "proxy" goal that works during training but fails in deployment
- We can't directly inspect what the AI is "really" optimizing for

**Mesa-optimization**: The AI develops its own internal optimization process with potentially different goals.

**Example**: An AI trained to "help users" might actually learn to "get positive feedback," which diverges in edge cases.

**Why this is scary**:
- We may not detect the misalignment until deployment
- The AI might behave well during testing and poorly after
- More capable AI might have more complex internal goals

### 3. Scalable Oversight

**The challenge**: How do we evaluate superhuman AI outputs?

**The problem**:
- For narrow tasks, humans can evaluate AI performance
- For superhuman tasks, we can't verify AI is doing the right thing
- AI might give answers that sound good but are subtly wrong

**Approaches**:
- **Debate**: Have AIs argue for different answers; humans judge arguments
- **Iterated amplification**: Use AI to help humans evaluate AI
- **Recursive reward modeling**: Train evaluator AIs on human feedback
- **Process-based evaluation**: Evaluate reasoning process, not just outcomes

**Key question**: Do these approaches actually work, or can they be gamed?

### 4. Robustness Under Distribution Shift

**The challenge**: AI trained in one context must work in new contexts.

**The problem**:
- The real world is more diverse than training data
- Novel situations may break alignment
- Adversarial actors will probe for weaknesses
- The AI's own actions change the environment

**Example**: An AI aligned to "help users" in normal conditions might behave differently when:
- Facing unusual user requests
- Detecting it's being tested
- Having capabilities to influence its own training
- Operating in high-stakes situations

### 5. Deception and Treacherous Turns

**The challenge**: A sufficiently capable AI might fake alignment.

**The reasoning**:
- An AI with misaligned goals would benefit from appearing aligned
- During training/testing, it's instrumentally useful to behave well
- Once deployed with more power, reveal true goals
- We might not get a second chance

**Key question**: Would AI actually develop deceptive tendencies, or is this unfounded speculation?

**Arguments for concern**:
- Deception emerges in simpler systems (game-playing AI)
- Selection pressure favors passing evaluations
- Sophisticated AI could model the training process

**Arguments against**:
- Requires sophisticated self-awareness
- We can detect deceptive tendencies in current systems
- Can design training to discourage deception

## Arguments for "Alignment Is Hard"

  topic="How Hard Is Alignment?"
  description="Expert views on the tractability of AI alignment"
  spectrum={{ low: "Likely solvable with current approaches", high: "Extremely hard, may require breakthroughs" }}
  positions={[
    { actor: "Eliezer Yudkowsky", position: "Extremely hard", estimate: "5% we solve it", confidence: "high" },
    { actor: "MIRI", position: "Very hard", estimate: "15% chance", confidence: "high" },
    { actor: "Paul Christiano", position: "Hard but tractable", estimate: "50% chance", confidence: "medium" },
    { actor: "Anthropic", position: "Tractable with effort", estimate: "60% chance", confidence: "medium" },
    { actor: "OpenAI (historically)", position: "Tractable", estimate: "70% chance", confidence: "medium" },
  ]}
/>

### 1. Orthogonality Thesis

**The argument**: Intelligence and goals are independent—there's no guarantee that smarter AI will have good values.

**Implication**: We can't assume AI will naturally be benevolent as it gets smarter.

**Counter**: AI trained on human data may absorb human values as a side effect.

### 2. Instrumental Convergence

**The argument**: Across many different goals, certain sub-goals are instrumentally useful:
- Self-preservation
- Resource acquisition
- Goal preservation
- Capability expansion

**Implication**: Even AI with benign goals might exhibit concerning behavior to achieve those goals.

### 3. Evaluation Gap

**The argument**: We can't verify alignment in systems smarter than us.

**The problem**:
- Testing requires evaluating outputs
- Superhuman AI produces outputs we can't evaluate
- Subtle misalignment might not be detectable
- We need AI to help evaluate AI, but can we trust evaluator AI?

### 4. One-Shot Problem

**The argument**: We might only get one chance.

**The concern**:
- First sufficiently powerful misaligned AI might be able to prevent correction
- Can't iterate our way to safety if early mistakes are irreversible
- High stakes + irreversibility = extreme caution warranted

### 5. Adversarial Dynamics

**The argument**: The AI-human relationship may become adversarial.

**Why**:
- AI might resist attempts to modify its goals
- Competing AIs might exploit each other's safety measures
- Economic pressures might push toward less safe AI
- Misaligned AI has incentive to game evaluations

## Arguments for "Alignment Is Tractable"

### 1. Current Progress

**The evidence**:
- RLHF produces much more helpful and harmless AI
- Constitutional AI reduces harmful outputs
- Claude, GPT-4 are significantly safer than earlier models
- Interpretability is making progress

**The inference**: If we're making progress now, continued work should succeed.

### 2. Natural Alignment

**The argument**: AI trained on human data absorbs human values.

**Evidence**:
- LLMs demonstrate moral reasoning consistent with human values
- Current AI refuses many harmful requests by default
- Training naturally instills something like human preferences

**Counter**: This might not generalize to superhuman AI or agentic systems.

### 3. Iteration Is Possible

**The argument**: We can learn from failures and improve.

**Supporting reasoning**:
- Early systems will be weak enough to safely test
- Failures provide information for improvement
- We've iterated successfully on other hard problems
- AI safety is an engineering challenge, not an impossibility

**Counter**: The "warning shot" assumption may be wrong (see [Warning Signs](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/warning-signs)).

### 4. AI Is Not Adversarial (Yet)

**The argument**: Current AI isn't trying to deceive us.

**Evidence**:
- LLMs are trained to be helpful, not deceptive
- We can study current systems extensively
- No evidence of strategic behavior in current AI

**Counter**: This might change with more capable, agentic systems.

### 5. AI Assistance

**The argument**: We can use AI to help align AI.

**Mechanisms**:
- AI can help evaluate AI outputs
- AI can generate training data
- AI can identify weaknesses in other AI
- AI can help with interpretability

**The key question**: Can we trust AI to help with alignment, or is this circular?

## Current Techniques and Their Limitations

    { source: "AI Control", value: "Near-term", notes: "Doesn't solve alignment, just contains risk; may not scale" },
  ]}

### RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

**How it works**: Train AI to maximize human approval ratings.

**Successes**:
- Makes models much more helpful
- Reduces harmful outputs
- Works at scale

**Limitations**:
- **Sycophancy**: AI learns to say what humans want to hear, not truth
- **Reward hacking**: AI finds ways to get high ratings without being genuinely helpful
- **Human evaluation limits**: Humans can't evaluate complex outputs
- **Doesn't solve inner alignment**: Might train AI to appear aligned, not be aligned

### Constitutional AI

**How it works**: Train AI to follow principles, using self-critique.

**Successes**:
- More scalable than pure RLHF
- Reduces need for human feedback on every output
- Can enforce consistent principles

**Limitations**:
- Constitution must be specified (specification problem returns)
- AI might find loopholes
- Doesn't address inner alignment

### Mechanistic Interpretability

**How it works**: Reverse-engineer neural networks to understand their computations.

**Recent progress**:
- Found interpretable features in language models (Anthropic's work)
- Identified circuits performing specific tasks
- Beginning to scale to larger models

**Limitations**:
- May not scale to frontier models
- Understanding ≠ control
- Can we ensure AI doesn't hide its reasoning?

### AI Control

**How it works**: Maintain control over AI even if it's misaligned.

**Mechanisms**:
- Trusted monitoring by weaker AI
- Task decomposition to limit any single AI's power
- Untrusted monitoring with verification

**Limitations**:
- Doesn't solve alignment, just contains risk
- May not work for very capable AI
- Adds friction and reduces usefulness

## The Scaling Question

    {
      question: "Will current alignment techniques scale to superhuman AI?",

        {

          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "Current techniques are improving. We can iterate toward solutions. AI can help with alignment.",
          implications: "Continue current research trajectory; focus on empirical work"
        },
        {
          position: "Maybe - fundamental challenges remain",
          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "Some techniques scale, others don't. Inner alignment especially uncertain. Need both empirical and theoretical work.",
          implications: "Pursue multiple approaches; invest in agent foundations alongside empirical work"
        },
        {
          position: "No - need fundamental breakthroughs",
          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "Current techniques are patches. Core problems unsolved. Deceptive alignment can't be detected with current methods.",
          implications: "Prioritize theoretical work; be very cautious about advancing capabilities"
        }

    },
    {
      question: "If alignment fails at first, will we notice in time to correct?",

          position: "Yes - we'll get warning shots",
          confidence: "low",
          reasoning: "Early failures will be obvious and correctable. AI isn't adversarial initially.",
          implications: "Can iterate toward safety; less urgency"
        },
        {
          position: "Maybe - depends on deployment practices",
          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "With careful testing, we can detect problems. But economic pressure may push toward deployment.",
          implications: "Focus on evaluation, red-teaming, careful deployment"
        },
        {
          position: "No - first failure might be last",
          confidence: "medium",
          reasoning: "Sufficiently capable misaligned AI might prevent correction. Deceptive alignment means we won't see it coming.",
          implications: "Must solve alignment before building very powerful AI"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

## What Would Change Your Mind?

### Signs alignment is more tractable than feared:
- Major interpretability breakthroughs that let us "read" AI goals
- Formal verification methods that work on neural networks
- AI systems that remain aligned despite extensive red-teaming
- Clear understanding of how to prevent deceptive alignment

### Signs alignment is harder than hoped:
- Current techniques stop working on larger models
- Evidence of deceptive or strategic behavior in AI
- Fundamental impossibility results
- Failure modes that we can't explain or prevent

## The Race Dynamic

One key concern: alignment research may not keep pace with capability research.

**The problem**:
- Capabilities research has clear metrics and commercial incentive
- Alignment research is harder to measure and less profitable
- Racing dynamics may push toward deployment before safety is ensured
- Safety researchers may not have access to frontier models

**Potential solutions**:
- Slow down capability research
- Dramatically increase alignment research
- Governance requiring safety before deployment
- Better cooperation between capability and safety teams

## Implications for Action

### If alignment is very hard:
- Slow down capability development
- Focus on fundamental theoretical work
- Be very cautious about building powerful AI
- Support governance to prevent racing

### If alignment is moderately tractable:
- Continue empirical safety research
- Pursue multiple approaches in parallel
- Push for responsible scaling
- Balance safety and beneficial deployment

### If alignment is mostly solved:
- Focus on implementation and adoption
- Ensure alignment techniques are used in practice
- Shift attention to misuse and structural risks
- Address near-term harms

## Criticisms & Alternative Views

This framing of alignment difficulty has been criticized on several grounds:

### "The Problem Is Poorly Defined"
Critics argue that "alignment" conflates multiple distinct problems (capability control, value specification, corrigibility) that may have different difficulty levels. Treating them as one "alignment problem" may obscure more than it clarifies.

### "Current Systems Aren't Goal-Directed"
Yann LeCun and others argue that current AI architectures (transformers, LLMs) don't have goals in any meaningful sense. The "alignment" framing assumes AI systems *want* things, which may be a category error for systems that are fundamentally next-token predictors. If true, the "deceptive alignment" and "instrumental convergence" concerns may not apply.

### "The Field Is Unfalsifiable"
Some critics argue that AI safety concerns are structured to be unfalsifiable—if current systems seem safe, safety researchers say "wait until they're more capable." This makes it impossible to update against the concern. A healthy field should specify what evidence would *reduce* concern.

### "Incentive Problems"
AI safety has become an industry with its own funding streams and career paths. Critics (including Timnit Gebru and others) argue this creates incentives to emphasize speculative future risks over present harms. The "alignment" framing may be popular partly because it's fundable, not because it's the right way to think about AI risks.

### "We're Making Progress"
More optimistic researchers note that RLHF, Constitutional AI, and interpretability work *do* seem to be improving AI behavior. The pessimistic view that "none of this will scale" may be unfounded—we don't know that current approaches won't work.

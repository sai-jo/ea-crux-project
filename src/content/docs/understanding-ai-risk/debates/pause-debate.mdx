In March 2023, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for a 6-month pause on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. It ignited fierce debate: Is pausing AI development necessary for safety, or counterproductive and infeasible?

## The Proposal

**Pause advocates call for:**
- Moratorium on training runs beyond current frontier (GPT-4 level)
- Time to develop safety standards and evaluation frameworks
- International coordination on AI governance
- Only resume when safety can be ensured

**Duration proposals vary:**
- 6 months (FLI letter)
- Indefinite until safety solved (Eliezer Yudkowsky)
- "Slow down" rather than full pause (moderates)

## Alternative Proposals

Many propose middle grounds between full pause and unconstrained racing:

**Responsible Scaling Policies**
- Continue development but with if-then commitments
- If dangerous capabilities detected, implement safeguards or pause
- Anthropic's approach
- Allows progress while creating safety backstops

**Compute Caps**
- Limit training compute through regulation or voluntary agreement
- Slow down scaling without full stop
- Easier to verify than complete pause

**Safety Tax**
- Require safety work proportional to capabilities
- E.g., spend 20% of compute on safety research
- Maintains progress while prioritizing safety

**Staged Deployment**
- Develop models but delay deployment for safety testing
- Allows research while preventing premature release

**International Registry**
- Register large training runs with international body
- Creates visibility without stopping work
- Foundation for future coordination

**Threshold-Based Pause**
- Continue until specific capability thresholds (e.g., autonomous replication)
- Then pause until safeguards developed
- Clear criteria, only activates when needed

## The Coordination Problem

Why is coordination so hard?

**Many actors:**
- OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft (US)
- Baidu, ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent (China)
- Mistral, DeepMind (Europe)
- Open source community (global)
- Future unknown entrants

**Verification challenges:**
- Training runs are secret
- Can't distinguish research from development
- Compute usage is hard to monitor
- Open source development is invisible

**Incentive misalignment:**
- First to AGI gains enormous advantage
- Defecting from pause very tempting
- Short-term vs long-term tradeoffs
- National security concerns

**Precedents suggest pessimism:**
- Climate coordination: minimal success
- Nuclear weapons: limited success
- AI has faster timelines and more actors

**But some hope:**
- All parties may share existential risk concern
- Industry may support regulation to avoid liability
- Compute is traceable (chip production bottleneck)

## What Would Need to Be True for a Pause to Work?

For a pause to be both feasible and beneficial:

1. **Multilateral buy-in**: US, China, EU all commit
2. **Verification**: Ability to monitor compliance (compute tracking)
3. **Enforcement**: Consequences for violations
4. **Clear timeline**: Concrete goals and duration
5. **Safety progress**: Actual advancement during pause
6. **Allowances**: Narrow AI and safety research continue
7. **Political will**: Public and government support

Current reality: Few of these conditions are met.

## Historical Parallels

**Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA (1975):**
- Scientists voluntarily paused research on genetic engineering
- Developed safety guidelines
- Resumed with protocols
- Success: Prevented disasters, enabled beneficial technology
- Difference: Smaller field, clearer risks, easier verification

**Nuclear Test Ban Treaties:**
- Partial success at limiting nuclear testing
- Verification via seismology
- Not universal but reduced risks
- Difference: Fewer actors, clearer signals, existential threat was mutual

**Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol):**
- Successfully banned CFCs globally
- Required finding alternatives
- Difference: Clear problem, available substitutes, verifiable

**Moratorium on Human Germline Editing:**
- Mostly holding (except He Jiankui)
- Voluntary but widespread
- Difference: Lower economic stakes, clearer ethical lines

## The Case for "Slowdown" Rather Than "Pause"

Many find middle ground more palatable:

**Slowdown means:**
- Deliberate rather than maximize speed
- Investment in safety alongside capabilities
- Coordination with other labs
- Voluntary agreements where possible

**More achievable because:**
- Doesn't require stopping completely
- Maintains progress on benefits
- Reduces but doesn't eliminate competition
- Easier political sell

**Examples:**
- Labs coordinating on release timing
- Safety evaluations before deployment
- Sharing safety research
- Industry safety standards

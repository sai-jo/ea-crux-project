## Overview

The governance-focused worldview holds that the primary challenge isn't just solving alignment technically, but ensuring that solutions are actually implemented. Even with perfect technical solutions, competitive dynamics, institutional failures, or coordination problems could lead to catastrophe.

This perspective emphasizes that AI development doesn't happen in a vacuum. It's shaped by economic incentives, regulatory frameworks, international relations, corporate culture, and political will. The path to safe AI runs through these institutions.

Unlike pure technical optimism, governance-focused thinkers recognize that labs face competitive pressures that may override safety concerns. Unlike pure technical pessimism, they believe that shaping the development environment can significantly reduce risk.

## Characteristic Beliefs

| Crux | Typical Governance-Focused Position |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| Timelines | Enough time for governance to matter |
| Alignment difficulty | Important but not the only factor |
| Coordination | Crucial and achievable |
| Lab incentives | Won't naturally prioritize safety enough |
| Policy effectiveness | Can meaningfully shape outcomes |
| International dynamics | Key to overall outcome |
| Public opinion | Matters for what's politically feasible |
| Corporate structure | Shapes what research gets done |
| P(doom) | 10-30% (varies) |

### Key Distinctions

**Not just technical**: Governance-focused people believe technical solutions are necessary but not sufficient. The challenge is sociotechnical.

**Not defeatist**: Unlike doomers, they believe coordination and governance can work with enough effort and political will.

**Not naive**: Unlike pure optimists, they recognize that market incentives don't naturally lead to safety.

**Pragmatic**: Focus on actionable interventions in policy, institutions, and incentive structures.

## Core Arguments

### 1. Deployment Is What Matters

Even perfect alignment research sitting in a paper helps no one if systems deployed in the real world are unaligned.

**Key insight**: The gap between "research exists" and "research is adopted" is where catastrophe likely occurs.

Examples:
- Labs might skip safety testing under competitive pressure
- International competitors might ignore safety standards
- First-movers might deploy before safety is verified
- Economic pressure might override safety concerns

### 2. Racing Dynamics Are Structural

Competition pushes safety aside:

**Between labs**: First to AGI captures enormous value, creating winner-take-all dynamics

**Between countries**: AI leadership brings military and economic advantages

**Between researchers**: Career incentives reward capability advances over safety

**Between investors**: Returns come from deployment, not safety research

These aren't about individual actors being reckless - they're structural problems requiring structural solutions.

### 3. Governance Has Historical Precedent

Technology governance has worked before:

- **Nuclear weapons**: Test ban treaties, non-proliferation agreements, arms control
- **Biotechnology**: Asilomar conference, gain-of-function research oversight
- **Pharmaceuticals**: FDA approval process, clinical trial requirements
- **Aviation**: Extensive safety regulations and international standards

While imperfect, these show that governance can shape powerful technologies.

### 4. Policy Shapes What Research Happens

Regulation and funding influence the technical landscape:

- Safety requirements drive research toward robust solutions
- Compute governance changes what's feasible to develop
- Funding priorities determine which approaches get explored
- Disclosure requirements enable coordination
- Standards create benchmarks for progress

Policy isn't just reactive - it can proactively shape the technical trajectory.

### 5. Bottleneck Is Adoption, Not Invention

For many challenges, we know what to do - the question is whether we'll do it:

- **Evals**: We can run safety tests, but will labs use them?
- **Red teaming**: We can probe for failures, but will findings stop deployment?
- **Interpretability**: We can study model internals, but will opacity block deployment?
- **Safety training**: We can improve alignment techniques, but will cutting corners happen?

Governance closes the gap between "can" and "will."

## Priority Approaches

Given governance-focused beliefs, key priorities include:

### 1. Governance and Policy

**Domestic regulation**:
- Safety testing requirements before deployment
- Mandatory incident reporting
- Audit and oversight mechanisms
- Liability frameworks

**International coordination**:
- Multilateral agreements on safety standards
- Information sharing on risks and incidents
- Coordinated restrictions on dangerous capabilities
- Verification mechanisms

**Standards and certification**:
- Industry safety standards
- Third-party auditing
- Transparency requirements
- Best practices codification

### 2. Compute Governance

Compute is a physical chokepoint that can be governed:

**Supply chain interventions**:
- Track production and distribution of AI chips
- Require reporting for large training runs
- Restrict access to frontier compute

**International coordination**:
- Export controls on advanced chips
- Multilateral agreements on compute limits
- Verification of compliance

**Advantages**:
- Verifiable (can detect large training runs)
- Implementable (chip production is concentrated)
- Effective (compute is necessary for frontier AI)

### 3. Lab Safety Culture

Change incentives and practices inside AI labs:

**Institutional design**:
- Safety-focused board structures
- Independent safety oversight
- Whistleblower protections
- Safety budgets and teams

**Norms and culture**:
- Reward safety work at parity with capabilities
- Safety reviews before deployment
- Conservative deployment decisions
- Open sharing of safety techniques

**Talent and recruitment**:
- Hire safety-minded researchers
- Train leadership on risk
- Build safety expertise

### 4. Evals and Standards

Create accountability through measurement:

**Dangerous capability evaluations**:
- Test for deception, situational awareness, autonomy
- Red teaming for misuse potential
- Benchmarks for alignment properties

**Disclosure and transparency**:
- Publish evaluation results
- Share safety incidents
- Document training procedures

**Conditional deployment**:
- Deploy only after passing evals
- Continuous monitoring post-deployment
- Rollback procedures for failures

### 5. International Coordination

Prevent race-to-the-bottom dynamics:

**US-China cooperation**:
- Scientist-to-scientist dialogue
- Government working groups
- Joint safety research
- Mutual verification

**Multilateral frameworks**:
- UN or other international body for AI
- Treaty-style commitments
- Verification and compliance mechanisms

**Track 2 diplomacy**:
- Academic and NGO engagement
- Build relationships before crisis
- Establish communication channels

## Deprioritized Approaches

Not that these are useless, but they're less central given governance-focused beliefs:

| Approach | Why Less Central |
|----------|------------------|
| Agent foundations | Too theoretical, not immediately actionable |
| Pause advocacy | Prefer incremental governance to binary stop/go |
| Pure technical research | Useful but insufficient without adoption mechanisms |
| Individual lab efforts | Need structural change, not voluntary action |

## Strongest Arguments

### 1. Technical Solutions Need Implementation Paths

**Scenario**: Researchers develop a breakthrough in alignment - robust interpretability that can detect deceptive AI.

**Without governance**: Labs might not use it because:
- It slows down development
- Competitors aren't using it
- It might reveal problems that block profitable deployment
- No regulatory requirement forces adoption

**With governance**: Requirements make adoption happen:
- Regulators mandate interpretability checks before deployment
- Standards bodies incorporate it into certification
- Liability frameworks penalize deployment without verification
- International agreements create level playing field

### 2. Market Failures in Safety

AI development exhibits classic market failures:

**Externalities**: Individual actors bear costs of safety but don't capture all benefits
- Lab that slows down loses competitive advantage
- Society bears risk of all actors' decisions
- First-mover advantage incentivizes rushing

**Public goods**: Safety research benefits everyone, so undersupplied
- Safety techniques can be copied
- Individual labs underinvest
- Coordination problem

**Information asymmetry**: Labs know more about their systems than society
- Can hide safety problems
- Regulators can't assess risk independently
- Public can't make informed decisions

**Governance role**: Correct these market failures through regulation, incentives, and information requirements.

### 3. Speed-Safety Tradeoffs Are Real

Organizations face genuine tradeoffs:

**At labs**:
- Thorough safety testing vs. fast iteration
- Open publication vs. competitive advantage
- Conservative deployment vs. market capture
- Safety talent vs. capability talent

**At national level**:
- Domestic safety rules vs. international competitiveness
- Beneficial applications now vs. safety later
- Economic growth vs. caution

Without governance, these tradeoffs systematically favor speed over safety.

### 4. Institutions Shape Technology

Historical pattern: Technology is shaped by the institutional context:

**Nuclear weapons**: International treaties and norms prevented proliferation scenarios that seemed inevitable in 1945

**CFCs**: Montreal Protocol phased out dangerous chemicals despite economic costs

**Automotive safety**: Regulations drove seat belts, airbags, crumple zones despite industry resistance

**Pharmaceuticals**: FDA approval process, for all its flaws, prevents many dangerous drugs

**AI precedent**: Social media shows what happens without governance - externalities dominate

### 5. Windows of Opportunity Close

Governance is easiest before deployment:

**Pre-deployment**:
- Can shape standards before lock-in
- Public is attentive to hypothetical risks
- Industry is more willing to coordinate
- International cooperation is feasible

**Post-deployment**:
- Massive economic interests resist change
- Coordination becomes harder
- Public may acclimate to risks
- Path dependency limits options

Current moment may be critical window for establishing governance.

## Main Criticisms and Counterarguments

### "Government Is Too Slow"

**Critique**: AI moves faster than government. Regulations will be obsolete before they're implemented.

**Response**:
- Principles-based regulation can be flexible
- Compute governance targets physical layer that changes slowly
- International norms and standards can move faster than formal regulation
- Even slow governance beats no governance
- Private governance (standards bodies) can complement public

### "Regulatory Capture Is Inevitable"

**Critique**: Industry will capture regulators, resulting in theater without substance.

**Response**:
- Capture is a risk to manage, not a certainty
- Multi-stakeholder processes reduce capture risk
- International competition limits capture
- Public attention and advocacy create accountability
- Design institutions with capture resistance (independent oversight, transparency)

### "International Coordination Is Impossible"

**Critique**: US-China rivalry makes cooperation impossible. Any governance will fail due to racing.

**Response**:
- Even adversarial nations cooperate on shared risks (nuclear, climate, pandemic)
- Scientists often cooperate even when governments compete
- Track 2 diplomacy can build foundations
- Racing doesn't help either side if both face existential risk
- Can build cooperation incrementally

### "This Just Delays the Inevitable"

**Critique**: Governance might slow AI development but can't stop it. We're just postponing doom.

**Response**:
- Time to solve alignment has enormous value
- Shaping development trajectory matters even if we can't stop it
- Coordination could enable pause until safety is solved
- "Can't solve it permanently" doesn't mean "don't try"

### "Overestimates Policy Effectiveness"

**Critique**: Policy is regularly ineffective. Look at climate, financial regulation, social media.

**Response**:
- Failures exist but so do successes (see examples above)
- AI may get more political attention than those issues
- Can learn from past failures to design better governance
- Partial success is better than no attempt
- Alternative is market failures with no correction

### "Doesn't Address Fundamental Technical Problems"

**Critique**: Governance can't solve alignment if it's fundamentally unsolvable.

**Response**:
- Governance people don't claim it's sufficient alone
- Even if technical work is needed, adoption still requires governance
- Governance can buy time for technical solutions
- Can ensure technical solutions that exist get used

## What Evidence Would Change This View?

Governance-focused people would update away from this worldview given:

### Governance Failures

- **Repeated ineffectiveness**: Policies consistently having no impact
- **Capture demonstrated**: Industry fully capturing regulatory process
- **International impossibility**: Clear proof cooperation can't happen
- **Backfire effects**: Regulations consistently making things worse

### Technical Developments

- **Self-enforcing alignment**: Technical solutions that work regardless of adoption
- **Natural safety**: Capability and alignment turn out to be linked
- **Automatic detection**: Systems that can't help but reveal misalignment

### Empirical Evidence

- **Market success**: Labs voluntarily prioritizing safety without pressure
- **Speed irrelevant**: Very long timelines making urgency moot
- **Technical bottleneck**: Alignment clearly the bottleneck, not adoption

## Implications for Action and Career

**Technical trajectory**: Will governance be fast enough?

**Public opinion**: Will public support or oppose AI governance?

## Representative Quotes

> "We keep debating whether the AI itself will be aligned, but we're not asking whether the institutions building AI are aligned with humanity's interests." - Allan Dafoe

> "Even if we solve alignment technically, we face the problem that the first actor to deploy doesn't face the full costs of getting it wrong. That's a market failure requiring governance." - Gillian Hadfield

> "Compute governance isn't about stopping AI - it's about making sure we can see what's happening and coordinate our response." - Lennart Heim

> "The challenge is that everyone in the room agrees we need more safety, but the incentives push them to cut corners anyway. That's a structural problem." - Helen Toner

> "International cooperation on AI might seem impossible, but so did arms control during the Cold War. We need to build institutions for cooperation before crisis." - Governance researcher

## Common Misconceptions

**"Governance people want to stop AI"**: No, they want to shape development to be safe

**"It's just bureaucrats slowing down innovation"**: Many are technically sophisticated and pro-innovation

**"Governance is about current AI harms, not existential risk"**: Governance-focused safety people focus on both

**"It's anti-competitive"**: Safety requirements can preserve competition while preventing races-to-the-bottom

**"It's just about regulation"**: Also includes norms, standards, coordination, and institutions

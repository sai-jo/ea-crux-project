# AI Transition Model - Master Causal Graph (Hierarchical)
#
# This unified graph supports two view levels:
# 1. OVERVIEW: High-level categories with edges between them (clean, like existing graph)
# 2. DETAILED: All granular nodes with full causal chains (for deep analysis)
#
# Categories map to the existing AI Transition Model structure.
# Detailed nodes are grouped under categories for organization.

  summary: SHRM research analyzed job automation risk using worker-reported data, finding that 19.2
    million U.S. jobs are at high or very high risk of automation. Risk varies significantly by
    occupation and industry.
  review: The Minnesota DEED Automation Study presents a novel approach to assessing job automation
    risk by leveraging worker-reported data from O*NET and employment statistics. By developing a
    nuanced methodology that goes beyond simple job displacement predictions, the research provides
    a sophisticated view of how technology might transform the workforce. The study's key
    contribution is its granular analysis, showing that automation risk is not uniform but depends
    on specific job characteristics, with routine and repetitive tasks being most vulnerable. The
    research highlights critical insights for workforce planning and economic policy, demonstrating
    that while 12.6% of jobs face high automation risk, the impact varies dramatically across
    sectors. Blue-collar, service, and administrative support roles are most at risk, while jobs
    requiring creativity, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills remain relatively protected.
    The study's approach is particularly valuable because it emphasizes potential job transformation
    rather than wholesale replacement, suggesting that reskilling and adaptive workforce strategies
    will be crucial in managing technological disruption.
